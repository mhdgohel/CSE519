PROLOGUE. 

Considering how many fools can calculate, it is 
surprising that it should be thought either a difficult 
or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to 
master the same tricks. 

Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are 
enormously difficult. The fools who write the text- 
books of advanced mathematics — and they are mostly 
clever fools — seldom take the trouble to show you how 
easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they 
seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous 
cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way. 

Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have 
had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg 
to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not . 
hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest wUl 
follow. What one fool can do, another can. 



CHAPTER L 

TO DELIVER YOU FROM THE PRELIMINARY 
TERRORS. 

The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth- 
form boys from even attempting to learn how to 
calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply stating 
what is the meaning — in common-sense terms — of the 
two principal symbols that are used in calculating. 

These dreadful symbols are : 

(1) d which merely means " a little bit of." 

Thus dx means a little bit of x\ or du means a 
little bit of u. Ordinary mathematicians think it 
more polite to say " an element of," instead of " a little 
bit of." Just as you please. But you will find that 
these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be 
indefinitely small. 

(2) I which is merely a long S, and may be called 
(if you like) " the sum of." 

Thus \dx means the sum of all the little bits 
of x; or I dt means the sum of all the little bits 
of t Ordinary mathematicians call this symbol " the 

C.M.E. A 



2 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

integral of." Now any fool can see that if x is 
considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of 
which is called dx, if you add them all up together 
you get the sum of all the dx's, (which is the same 
thing as the whole of x). The word " integral " simply 
means "the whole." If you think of the duration 
of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of 
it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The 
whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make 
one hour. 

When you see an expression that begins with this 
terrifying symbol, you will henceforth know that it 
is put there merely to give you instructions that you 
are now to perform the operation (if you can) of 
totalling up all the little bits that are indicated by 
the symbols that f ollow. 

That's alL 



CHAPTER II 

ON DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SMALLNESS. 

We shall find that in our processes of calculation we 
have to deal with small quantities of various degrees 
of smallness. 

We shall have also to learn under what circumstances 
we may consider small quantities to be so minute 
that we may omit them from consideration. Every- 
thing depends upon relative minuteness. 

Before we fix any rules let us think of some 
familiar cases. There are 60 minutes in the hour, 
24 hours in the day, 7 days in the week. There are 
therefore 1440 minutes in the day and 10080 minutes 
in the week. 

Obviously 1 minute is a very small quantity of 
time compared with a whole week. Indeed, our 
forefathers considered it small as compared with an 
hour, and called it "one minute," meaning a minute 
fraction — namely one sixtieth — of an hour. When 
they came to require still smaller subdivisions of time, 
they divided each minute into 60 still smaller parts, 
which, in Queen Elizabeth's days, they called " second 
minutes " {i.e., small quantities of the second order of 
minuteness). Nowadays we call these small quantities 



4 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

of the second order of smallness " seconds." But few 
people know why they are so called. 

Now if one minute is so small as compared with a 
whole day, how much smaller by comparison is one 
second ! 

Again, think of a farthing as compared with a sove- 
reign : it is worth only a little more than T ^V ir part. 
A farthing more or less is of precious little importance 
compared with a sovereign: it may certainly be re- 
garded as a small quantity. But compare a farthing 
with £1000 : relatively to this greater sum, the 
farthing is of no more importance than l0 x 00 of a 
farthing would be to a sovereign. Even a golden 
sovereign is relatively a negligible quantity in the 
wealth of a millionaire. 

Now if we fix upon any numerical fraction as 
constituting the proportion which for any purpose 
we call relatively small, we can easily state other 
fractions of a higher degree of smallness. Thus if, 
for the purpose of time, -£$ be called a small fraction, 
then -gV of -^j- (being a small fraction of a small 
fraction) may be regarded as a small quantity of the 
second order of smallness.* 

Or, if for any purpose we were to take 1 per cent. 
(i.e., y^j) as a small fraction, then 1 per cent, of 
1 per cent, (i.e., ■ ,l 00 ) would be a small fraction 
of the second order of smallness ; and lt00 o t000 would 

* The mathematicians talk about the second order of " magnitude n 
(i.e. greatness) when they really mean second order of smallne88. 
This is very confusing to beginners. 



DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SMALLNESS 5 

be a small fraction of the third order of smallness, 
being 1 per cent, of 1 per cent, of 1 per cent. 

Lastly, suppose that for some very precise purpose 
we should regard lt00 o t00 o as " sma U-" Thus, if a 
first-rate chronometer is not to lose or gain more than 
half a minute in a year, it must keep time with an 
accuracy of 1 part in 1,051,200. Now if, for such a 
purpose, we regard lt00 o >000 (or one millionth) as a 
small quantity, then ± of ± , that is, 

" J ' 1,000,000 1,000,000* ' 

1,000,000,000,0 ^0 ( or one billionth) will be a small 
quantity of the second order of smallness, and may 
be utterly disregarded, by comparison. 

Then we see that the smaller a small quantity itself 
is, the more negligible does the corresponding small 
quantity of the second order become. Hence we 
know that in all cases we are justified in neglecting 
the small quantities of the second — or third (or 
higher) — orders, if only we take the small quantity 
of the first order small enough in itself. 

But it must be remembered that small quantities, 
if they occur in our expressions as factors multiplied 
by some other factor, may become important if the 
other factor is itself large. Even a farthing becomes 
important if only it is multiplied by a few hundred. 

Now in the calculus we write dx for a little bit 
of x. These things such as dx, and du, and dy, are 
called "differentials," the differential of x, or of u, 
or of y, as the case may be. [You read them as 
dee-eks, or dee-you, or dee-wy.] If dx be a small bit 
of x, and relatively small of itself, it does not follow 



6 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

that such quantities as x*dx, or x 2 dx, or a x dx are 

negligible. But dx X dx would be negligible, being a 
small quantity of the second order. 

A very simple example will serve as illustration. 

Let us think of a? as a quantity that can grow by 
a small amount so as to become x+dx, where dx is 
the small increment added by growth. The square 
of this is x 2 + 2x*dx+(dx) 2 . The second term is 
not negligible because ifc is a first-order quantity; 
while the third term is of the second order of smali- 
ness, being a bit of a bit of x. Thus if we took 
dx to mean numerically, say, ■£$ of x, then the second 
term would be ^5- of x 2 , whereas the third term would 
be s^o of x 2 . This last term is clearly less important 
than the second. But if we go further and tak6 
dx to mean only i0 1 00 of x, then the second term 
will be j-gVff of x 2 , while the third term will b$ 

onl y 1.000,000 of ^ 




Fig. 1. 



Geometrically this may be depicted as follows: 
Draw a square (Fig. 1) the side of which we will 
take to represent x. Now suppose the square to 
grow by having a bit dx added to its , size each

way. The enlarged square is made up of the original 
square x 2 , the two rectangles at the top and on the 
right, each of which is of area x*dx (or together 
2x • dx), and the little square at the top right-hand 
corner which is (dx) 2 . In Fig. 2 we have taken dx as

quite a big fraction of x — about \. But suppose we 
had taken it only -j-^j- — about the thickness of an 
inked line drawn with a fine pen. Then the little 
corner square will have an area of only 10t Q 00 of x 2 , 
and be practically invisible. Clearly (dx) 2 is negligible 
if only we consider the increment dx to be itself 
small enough. 

Let us consider a simile. 

Suppose a millionaire were to say to his secretary : 
next week I will give you a small fraction of any 
money that comes in to me. Suppose that the 
secretary were to say to his boy: I will give you a 
small fraction of what I get. Suppose the fraction 
in each case to be T ^ part. Now if Mr. Millionaire 
received during the next week £1000, the secretary 



8 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

would receive £10 and the boy 2 shillings. Ten 
pounds would be a small quantity compared with 
£1000; but two shillings is a small small quantity 
indeed, of a very secondary order. But what would 
be the disproportion if the fraction, instead of being 
•j-J^j-, had been settled at T ^nj- part? Then, while 
Mr. Millionaire got his £1000, Mr. Secretary would 
get only £1, and the boy less than one farthing! 
The witty Dean Swift * once wrote : 

" So, Nat'ralists observe, a Flea 
"Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey. 
" And these have smaller Fleas to bite 'em, 
" And so proceed ad infinitum? 

An ox might worry about a flea of ordinary 
size — a small creature of the first order of smallness. 
But he would probably not trouble himself about a 
flea's flea ; being of the second order of smallness, it 
would be negligible. Even a gross of fleas' fleas 
would not be of much account to the ox.

CHAPTER III. 

ON RELATIVE GROWINGS. 

All through the calculus we are dealing with quan* 
tities that are growing, and with rates of growth. 
We classify all quantities into two classes : constants 
and variables. Those which we regard as of fixed 
value, and call constants, we generally denote alge- 
braically by letters from the beginning of the 
alphabet, such as a, b, or c; while those which we 
consider as capable of growing, or (as mathematicians 
say) of " varying," we denote by letters from the end 
of the alphabet, such as %, y, z, a, v, w, or sometimes t. 

Moreover, we are usually dealing with more than 
one variable at once, and thinking of the way in 
which one variable depends on the other : for instance, 
we think of the way in which the height reached 
by a projectile depends on the time of attaining that 
height. Or, we are asked to consider a rectangle of 
given area, and to enquire how any increase in the 
length of it will compel a corresponding decrease in 
the breadth of it. Or, we think of the way in which 
any variation in the slope of a ladder will cause the 
height that it reaches, to vary. 

Suppose we have got two such variables that 



10 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



depend one on the other. An alteration in one will 
bring about an alteration in the other, because of this 
dependence. Let us call one of the variables x, and 
the other that depends on it y. 

Suppose we make x to vary, that is to say, we 
either alter it or imagine it to be altered, by adding 
to it a bit which we call dx. We are thus causing x 
to become x + dx. Then, because x has been altered, 
y will have altered also, and will have become y+dy. 
Here the bit dy may be in some cases positive, in 
others negative ; and it won't (except very rarely) be 
the same size as dx. 

Take two examples. 

(1) Let x and y be respectively the base and the 
height of a right-angled triangle (Fig. 4), of which 



syy 




Fig. 4. 

the slope of the other side is fixed at 30°. If we 
suppose this triangle to expand and yet keep its 
angles the same as at first, then, when the base grows 
so as to become x+dx, the height becomes y + dy. 
Here, increasing x results in an increase of y. The 
little triangle, the height of which is dy, and the bas© 



ON RELATIVE GROWINGS 



11 



of which is dx, is similar to the original triangle ; and 

it is obvious that the value of the ratio — ^ is the 

dx 

same as that of the ratio K As the angle is 30° it 



will be seen that here 



x 
dy_ 1 



(2) Let x represent, in Fig. 5, the horizontal dis- 
tance, from a wall, of the bottom end of a ladder. 




AB, of fixed length; and let y be the height it 
reaches up the wall. Now y clearly depends on x. 
It is easy to see that, if we pull the bottom end A a 
bit further from the wall, the top end B will come 
down a little lower. Let us state this in scientific 
language. If we increase x to x+dx, then y will 
become y—dy; that is, when x receives a positive 



12 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

increment, the increment which results to y V\ 
negative. 

Yes, but how much? Suppose the ladder was so 
long that when the bottom end A was 19 inches from 
the wall the top end B reached just 15 feet from the 
ground. Now, if you were to pull the bottom end 
out 1 inch more, how much would the top end come 
down? Put it all into inches: a? =19 inches, ?/=180 
inches. Now the increment of x which we call dx, 
is 1 inch: or x + dx = 20 inches. 

How much will y be diminished ? The new height 
will be y — dy. If we work out the height by Euclid 
I. 47, then we shall be able to find how much dy will 
be. The length of the ladder is 

*/(180) 2 + (19) 2 =181 inches. 
Clearly then, the new height, which is y — dy> will be 
such that 

(y-#) 2 = (181) 2 -(20) 2 = 32761 -400 = 32361, 
y-dy = j32S6l = 179-89 inches. 
Now y is 180, so that dy is 180-179'89 = 0\L1 inch. 

So we see that making dx an increase of 1 inch 
has resulted in making dy a decrease of 0*11 inch. 
And the ratio of dy to dx may be stated thus : 
dy _ Oil 
dx 1 

It is also easy to see that (except in one particular 
position) dy will be of a different size from dx. 

Now right through the differential calculus we 
are hunting, hunting, hunting for a curious thing, 



ON RELATIVE GROWINGS 13 

a mere ratio, namely, the proportion which dy 
bears to dx when both of them are indefinitely 
small. 

It should be noted here that we can only find 

this ratio - ' ; when y and x are related to each 

other in some way, so that whenever x varies y does 
vary also. For instance, in the first example just 
taken, if the base x of the triangle be made longer, 
the height y of the triangle becomes greater also, 
and in the second example, if the distance x of the 
foot of the ladder from the wall be made to increase, 
the height y reached by the ladder decreases in a 
corresponding manner, slowly at first, but more and 
more rapidly as x becomes greater. In these cases 
the relation between x and y is perfectly definite, 

it can be expressed mathematically, being - = tan 30° 

and x 2 +y 2 = l 2 (where I is the length of the ladder) 

respectively, and -^- has the meaning we found in 
each case. 

If, while x is, as before, the distance of the foot 
of the ladder from the wall, y is, instead of the 
height reached, the horizontal length of the wall, or 
the number of bricks in it, or the number of years 
since it was built, any change in x would naturally 

cause no change whatever in y ; in this case ~ has 

no meaning whatever, and it is not possible to find 



14 CALCULUS MADE EAST 

an expression for it. Whenever we use differentials 
dx y dy, dz> etc., the existence of some kind of 
relation between x } y> %, etc., is implied, and this 
relation is called a "function" in x, y. z, etc.; the 
two expressions given above, for instance, namely 

— = tan 30° and x 2 +y 2 = l 2 , are functions of x and y. 

x 

Such expressions contain implicitly (that is, contain 
without distinctly showing it) the means of expressing 
either x in terms of y or y in terms of x, and for 
this reason they are called implicit functions in 
x and y\ they. can be respectively put into the forms 

2/ = a? tan 30° or x=. 



tan 30° 

and y = *Jl 2 —x* or x = s/'P — y 2 . 

These last expressions state explicitly (that is, dis- 
tinctly) the value of x in terms of y, or of y in terms 
of x, and they are for this reason called explicit 
functions of x or y. For example x 2 +3 = 2y — 7 is 
an implicit function in x and y\ it may be written 

#? 2 + 10 

y = — ~ — (explicit function of x) or x = *j2y — 10 

(explicit function of y). We see that an explicit 
function in x, y, z, etc., is simply something the 
value of which changes when x, y, z, etc., are 
changing, either one at the time or several together. 
Because of this, the value of the explicit function is 
called the dependent variable, as it depends on the 
value of the other variable quantities in the function; 



ON RELATIVE GROWINGS 15 

these other variables are called the independent 
variables because their value is not determined from 
the value assumed b}' the function. For example, 
if u = x 2 &inQ, x and 6 are the independent variables, 
and ti is the dependent variable. 

Sometimes the exact relation between several 
quantities x, y, z either is not known or it is not 
convenient to state it ; it is only known, or con- 
venient to state, that there is some sort of relation 
between these variables, so that one cannot alter 
either x or y or z singly without affecting the other 
quantities; the existence of a function in x, y, z is 
then indicated by the notation F(x, y, z) (implicit 
function) or by x = F(y, z), y = F(x, z) or z = F(x, y) 
(explicit function). Sometimes the letter f or <j> is used 
instead of F> so that y=F(x) y y=f(x) and y = <p(x) 
all mean the same thing, namely, that the value of 
y depends on the value of x in some way which is 
not stated. 

We call the ratio -^> " the differential coefficient of 

y with respect to x." It is a solemn scientific name 
for this very simple thing. But we are not going 
to be frightened by solemn names, when the things 
themselves are so easy. Instead of being frightened 
we will simply pronounce a brief curse on the 
stupidity of giving long crack-jaw names ; and, having 
relieved our minds, will go on to the simple thing 

ftself , namely the ratio -j?-. 



16 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

In ordinary algebra which you learned at school, 
you were always hunting after some unknown 
quantity which you called x or y\ or sometimes 
there were two unknown quantities to be hunted 
for simultaneously. You have now to learn to go 
hunting in a new way; the fox being now neither 
x nor y. Instead of this you have to hunt for this 

curious cub called -~. The process of finding the 

value of -^ is called " differentiating." But, remember, 

what is wanted is the value of this ratio when both 
dy and dx are themselves indefinitely small. The 
true value of the differential coefficient is that to which 
it approximates in the limiting case when each of 
them is considered as infinitesimally minute. 

Let us now learn how to go in quest of -~. 



ON RELATIVE GROWINGS 17 

NOTE TO CHAPTER III. 
How to read Differentials. 

It will never do to fall into the schoolboy error of 
thinking that dx means d times x, for d is not a 
factor — it means "an element of" or "a bit of" 
whatever follows. One reads dx thus : " dee-eks." 

In case the reader has no one to guide him in such 
matters it may here be simply said that one reads 
differential coefficients in the following way. The 
differential coefficient 

-jf- is read "dee-wy by dee-eks" or "dee-wy over 

(XX 

dee-eks" 

So also -j- is read " dee-you by dee-tee" 

Second differential coefficients will be met with 

later on. They are like this : 

d ?/ 

-r-^ ; which is read " dee-two-wy over dee-eks-squared" 

and it means that the operation of differentiating y 
with respect to x has been (or has to be) performed 
twice over. 

Another way of indicating that a function has beeij, 
differentiated is by putting an accent to the symbol of 
the function. Thus if y = F(x) f which means that y 
is some unspecified function of x (see p. 14), we may 

/7( J?( r ¥*\ \ 

write F\x) instead of , . Similarly, F f, (x) 

will mean that the original function F(x) has been 
differentiated twice over with respect to x.

CHAPTER IV. 

SIMPLEST CASES. 

Now let us see how, on first principles, we can 
differentiate some simple algebraical expression. 

Case 1. 

Let us begin with the simple expression y = x*. 
Now remember that the fundamental notion abont 
the calculus is the idea of growing. Mathematicians 
call it varying. Now as y and x 2 are equal to one 
another, it is clear that if x grows, x 2 will also grow. 
And if x 2 grows, then y will also grow. What we 
have got to find out is the proportion between the 
growing of y and the growing of x. In other words 
our task is to find out the ratio between dy and dx, 

or, in brief, to find the value of -~. 

dx 

Let x, then, grow a little bit bigger and become 

$D+dx] similarly, y will grow a bit bigger and will 

become y-\-dy. Then, clearly, it will still be true 

that the enlarged y will be equal to the square of the 

enlarged a?. Writing this down, we have : 

y+dy = (x+dx) 2 . 

Doing the squaring we get : 

y+dy=x 2 +2x • dx+(dx) 2 . 



SIMPLEST CASES 19 

What does (dx) 2 mean ? Remember that dx meant 
a bit — a little bit — of x. Then (dx) 2 will mean a little 
bit of a little bit of x; that is, as explained above 
(p. 4), it is a small quantity of the second order 
of smallness. It may therefore be discarded as quite 
inconsiderable in comparison with the other terms 
Leaving it out, we then have : 

y+ dy = x 2 + 2x • dx. 

Now y = x 2 ; so let us subtract this from the equa- 
tion and we have left 

dy=2x'dx. 

Dividing across by dx, we find 

dx 

Now this* is what we set out to find. The ratio of 
the growing of y to the growing of x is, in the case 
before us, found to be 2x. 

* N.B. — This ratio -^ is the result of differentiating y with 

respect to x. Differentiating means finding the differential co- 
efficient. Suppose we had some other function of x, as, for 
example, u=7x 2 + 3. Then if we were told to differentiate this 
with respect to x, we should have to find -^, or, what is the same 
thing, — - — - — '-!■. On the other hand, we may have a case in which 

time was the independent variable (see p. 15), such as tin's : 
y=b + $at 2 . Then, if we were told to differentiate it, that means we 
must find its differential coefficient with respect to t. So that then 

our business would be to try to find -J?, that is, to find * .^ a K 

at at

Numei'ical example. 

Suppose x = 100 and .\ y = 10,000. Then let x grow 
till it becomes 101 (that is, let dx = l). Then the 
enlarged y will be 101 X 101 = 10,201. But if we agree 
that we may ignore small quantities of the second 
order, 1 may be rejected as compared with 10,000; so 
we may round off the enlarged y to 10,200. y has 
grown from 10,000 to 10,200 ; the bit added on is dy, 
which is therefore 200. 

-r^ = -y- = 200. According to the algebra- working

of the previous paragraph, we find -^ = 2x. And so 

it is ; f or x = 100 and 2a? = 200. 

But, you will say, we neglected a whole unit. 
Well, try again, making dx a still smaller bit. 
Try dx = T \. Then x+dx = 100'l, and 

(x+dx) 2 = 1001 x 100-1 = 10,020-01. 

Now the last figure 1 is only one-millionth part of 

the 10,000, and is utterly negligible; so we may 

take 10,020 without the little decimal at the end. 

dv 20 
And this makes dy = 20; and -^ = ^- = 200, which 

is still the same as 2x. 

Case 2. 

Try differentiating y = a? in the same way. 

We let y grow to y+dy f while x grows to x+do& 

Then we have 

y+dy = (x+dx)\ 



SIMPLEST CASES S] 

Doing the cubing we obtain 

y+dy = x 3 + Sx 2 -dx + Sx {dx) 2 + (dxf. 

Now we know that we may neglect small quantities 
of the second and third orders ; since, when dy and dx 
are both made indefinitely small, {dx) 2 and {dxf 
will become indefinitely smaller by comparison. So, 
regarding them as negligible, we have left : 
y+dy = x*+3x 2 • dx. 
But y = x 3 ; and, subtracting this, we have % 
dy = Sx 2 • dx, 

and ^ = 3aft 

ax 

Case 3c 

Try differentiating y = x\ Starting as before by 
letting both y and x grow a bit, we have : 

y + dy = {x + dx)\ 
Working out the raising to the fourth power, we get 

y+dy = x*-\- 4<x 3 dx + 6x 2 (dxf + 4# {dxf + {dxf. 
Then, striking out the terms containing all the 
higher powers of dx, as being negligible by com- 
parison, we have 

y + dy = a? 4 + 4<x?dx. 
Subtracting the original y — x*> we have left 
dy = &x z dx % 

and -^- = 4aA

Now all these cases are quite easy. Let us collect, 
the results to see if we can infer any general rule. 
Put them in two columns, the values of y in one 

and the corresponding values found for -— in the 
other: thus 



y

Just look at these results : the operation of differen- 
tiating appears to have had the effect of diminishing 
the power of a? by 1 (for example in the last case 
reducing x* to x z )> and at the same time multiplying 
by a number (the same number in fact which original] y 
appeared as the power). Now, when you have once 
seen this, you might easily conjecture how the others 
will run. You would expect that differentiating x 5 
would give 5x* f or differentiating oft would give 6x 5 . 
It" you hesitate, try one of these, and see whether 
the conjecture comes right. 

Try y = x 5 . 

Then y+dy = (x+dx) 5 

= oft+ 5x*dx + \Qx\dxf + \0x\dxf 
+ 5x(dxy + {dx) 5 . 

Neglecting all the terms containing small quantities 
of the higher orders, we have left 
y+dy=x*+ 5x 4 dx, 



SIMPLEST OASES 23 



and subtracting y = x 5 leaves us 
dy -^ 5x*dx, 

whence -^- = 5x*, exactly as we supposed. 



Following out logically our observation, we should 
conclude that if we want to deal with any higher 
power, — call it n — we could tackle it in the same 
way. 

Let y = x n , 

then, we should expect to find that 

ax 

For example, let n = 8, then y=x?\ and differ- 
entiating it would give -~ = Sx 7 . 

And, indeed, the rule that differentiating x n gives as 
the result nx n ~ x is true for all cases where n is a 
whole number and positive. [Expanding (x+dx) n by 
the binomial theorem will at once show this.] But 
the question whether it is true for cases where n 
has negative or fractional values requires further 
consideration. 

Case of a negative power. 
Let y = x~\ Then proceed as before: 
y+dy = (x+dx)- 2

Expanding this by the binomial theorem (see p. 141), 
we get 

L x 1x2 \x / J

So, neglecting the small quantities of higher orders 
of smallness, we have : 

y+dy = x~ 2 — 2x' s 'dx. 

Subtracting the original y = x~ 2 t we find 

dy = — 2x~ s dx,

And this is still in accordance with the rule inferred 
above.

Summary. Let us see how far we have got. We 
have arrived at the following rule : To differentiate 
x n , multiply it by the power and reduce the power by 
one, so giving us iioo n ' 1 as the result.

CHAPTER V. 

NEXT STAGE. WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS. 

In our equations we have regarded x as growing, 
and as a result of x being made to grow y also 
changed its value and grew. We usually think of x 
as a quantity that we can vary; and, regarding the 
variation of a? as a sort of cause, we consider the re- 
sulting variation of y as an effect. In other words, we 
regard the value of y as depending on that of x. Both 
x and y are variables, but x is the one that we operate 
upon, and y is the "dependent variable." In all the 
preceding chapter we have been trying to find out 
rules for the proportion which the dependent variation 
in y bears to the variation independently made in x. 

Our next step is to find out what effect on the 
process of differentiating is caused by the presence of 
constants, that is, of numbers which don't change 
when x or y changes its value. 

Added Constants. 

Let us begin with some simple case of an added 
constant, thus : 

Let y = x?+5. 

Just as before, let us suppose x to grow to x + dx and 
y to grow to y-hdy. 



WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS 21 

Then: y + dy = (x+dxf+5 

= x d + Sx 2 dx + Sx(dx) 2 + (dxf + 5. 
Neglecting the small quantities of higher orders, this 
becomes y+dy = x* + 3x 2 -dx + 5. 
Subtract the original y = a? + 5, and we have left: 
dy = Sx 2 dx. 

ax 

So the 5 has quite disappeared. It added nothing 
to the growth of x, and does not enter into the 
differential coefficient. If we had put 7, or 700, or 
any other number, instead of 5, it would have dis- 
appeared. So if we take the letter a, or 6, or c to 
represent any constant, it will simply disappear when 
we differentiate. 

If the additional constant had been of negative value, 
such as — 5 or — 6, it would equally have disappeared. 

Multiplied Constants. 
Take as a simple experiment this case : 
Lety = 7x\ 
Then on proceding as before we get ;■ 
y + dy = 7(x+dx) 2 

= 7{x 2 + 2x-dx+(dxf} 
= 7x 2 + Ux-dx+7(dxf. 
Then, subtracting the original y = 7x?, and neglecting 
the last term, we have 

dy = 14<x*dx. 

-J£=14<x. 
ax 



28 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

Let us illustrate this example by working out the 
graphs of the equations y = 7x 2 and -^ = 14#, by 
assigning to x a set of successive values, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., 
and finding the corresponding values of y and of —-.

Fig. 6a.— Graph of ^=14as. 



Now plot these values to some convenient scale, 
and we obtain the two curves, Figs. 6 and 6a. 



WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS 29 

Carefully compare the two figures, and verify by 
inspection that the height of the ordinate of the 
derived curve, Fig. 6a, is proportional to the slope of 
the original curve,* Fig. 6, at the corresponding value 
of x. To the left of the origin, where the original 
curve slopes negatively (that is, downward from left 
to right) the corresponding ordinates of the derived 
curve are negative. 

Now^if we look back at p. 19, we shall see that 
simply differentiating x 2 gives us 2a?. So that the 
differential coefficient of 7x 2 is just 7 times as big as 
that of x 2 . If we had taken 8x 2 , the differential 
coefficient would have come out eight times as great 
as that of x 2 . If we put y = ax 2 , we shall get 

-^ = ax2x. 
ax 

If we had begun with y = ax n } we should have had 

~ = axnx n ~\ So that any mere multiplication by 

a constant reappears as a mere multiplication when 
the thing is differentiated. And, what is true about 
multiplication is equally true about division: for if, 
in the example above, we had taken as the constant ^ 
instead of 7, we should have had the same -f come 
out in the result after differentiation.

Some Further Examples. 

The following further examples, fully worked out, 
will enable you to master completely the process of 
differentiation as applied to ordinary algebraical ex- 
pressions, and enable you to work out by yourself the 
examples given at the end of this chapter.

it is, however, always worth while to try whether the 
expression can be put in a simpler form. 

First we must try to bring it into the form y = somQ 
expression involving x only. 

The expression may be written 

(a-b)y+(a+b)x = (x+y)s/a 2 -b 2 . 

Squaring, we get 

(a-b) 2 y 2 +(a+b) 2 x 2 +2(a+b)(a-b)xy 

= (x 2 +y 2 +2xy)(a 2 -b 2 \ 
which simplifies to 

(a-b) 2 y 2 +(a+b) 2 x 2 =x 2 (a 2 -b 2 )+y 2 (a 2 -b 2 ); 

or [(a-b?-(a 2 -b 2 )]y 2 = [(a 2 -b 2 )-(a+b) 2 ]x\ 

that is 2b(b-a)y 2 =-2b(b+a)x 2 ;

hence y = ^^x and ^J = V^- 

(4) The volume of a cylinder of radius r and height 
h is given by the formula V= 7rr 2 h. Find the rate of 
variation of volume with the radius when r = 5*5 in, 
and h = 20 in. If r = h, find the dimensions of the 
cylinder so that a change of 1 in. in radius causes a 
change of 400 cub. in. in the volume. 

The rate of variation of V with regard to r is 

dr 

If r=5'5 in. and h = 20 in. this becomes 690*8. It 

means that a change of radius of 1 inch will cause a 

change of volume of 690*8 cub. inch. This can be 

easily verified, for the volumes with r = 5 and f=6

Compare the sensitiveness of the pyrometer at 
temperatures 800 n C, 1000° C, 1200° C., given that it 
read 25 when the temperature was 1000° C. 

The sensitiveness is the rate of variation of the

CHAPTER VI. 

SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS, AND 
QUOTIENTS. 

We have learned how to differentiate simple alge- 
braical functions such as x 2 +c or ax 4 ", and we have 
now to consider how to tackle the sum of two or 
more functions. 
For instance, let 

y=(x 2 +c)+(ax*+1>); 

what will its -^ be? How are we to go to work 

on this new job ? 

The answer to this question is quite simple: just 
differentiate them, one after the other, thus : 

-~ = 2x + 4<ax s . (Arts.) 

if you have any doubt whether this is right, try 
a more general case, working it by first principles. 
And this is the way. 

Let y = u+v, where u is any function of x, and 
v any oLher function of x. Then, letting x increase 
to x + dx 9 y will increase to y + dy; and u wilj 
increase to u+du; and v to v+dv. 



36 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

And we shall have : 

y+dy=u+du+v+dv. 
Subtracting the original y = u+v, we get 
dy = du+dv, 
and dividing through by dx, we get : • 

dydu dv 

dx ~~ dx dx 
This justifies the procedure. You differentiate each 
function separately and add the results. So if now 
we take the example of the preceding paragraph, and 
put in the values of the two functions, we shall have, 
using the notation shown (p. 17), 

dy_ d(x 2 +c) djax^+b) 
dx~ dx dx 

= 2x +4a# 3 , 

exactly as before. 

If there were three functions of x, which we may 
call u, v and w, so that 

y=u+v+w; 
,, dy da dv dw 

CtX d/X (XX (XX 

As for the rule about subtraction, it follows at once ; 
for if the function v had itself had a negative sign, its 
differential coefficient would also be negative ; so that 
by differentiating 

y = u-v, 

, t , , dy du dv 

we should get -T-=*^r i-* 

* dx dx dx 



SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS 3? 

But when we come to do with Products, the thing 
is not quite so simple. 

Suppose we were asked to differentiate the expression 
y = (x 2 -+c)x(ax*+b), 
what are we to do ? The result will certainly not 
be 2x X 4>ax s ; for it is easy to see that neither c x ax\ 
nor x 2 x b, would have been taken into that product. 

Now there are two ways in which we may go 
to work. 

First way. Do the multiplying first, and, having 
worksd it out, then differentiate. 

Accordingly, we multiply together x 2 + c and ax^ + b< 

This gives axP+acx* + bx 2 + bc. 

Now differentiate, and we get : 

-~ = ()ax 5 + 4<acx s -t- 26a?. 

Second way. Go back to first principles, and 
consider the equation 

y = uxv, 
where u is one function of x, and v is any other 
function of x. Then, if x grows to be x + dx; and 
y to y + dy; and u becomes u+du; and v becomes 
v + dv, we shall have : 

y+dy = (u+du)x(v + dv) 

= U'V+ii'dv + v*du+du*dv. 
Now du • dv is a small quantity of the second order 
of smallness, and therefore in the limit may be 
discarded, leaving 

y+dy=u>v+u*dv+V'du. 



38 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

Then, subtracting the original y = U'V } we have left 
dy = u*dv+v*du; 
and, dividing through by dx, we get the result : 
dy _ dv_. dn 
dx dx dx 
Thi3 shows that our instructions will be as follows : 
To differentiate the product of two functions, multiply 
each function by the differential coefficient of the 
other, and add together the two products so obtained. 

You should note that this process amounts to the 
following : Treat u as constant while you differen- 
tiate v ; then treat v as constant while you differentiate 

u ; and the whole differential coefficient ~- will be 

dx 

the sum of the results of these two treatments. 

Now, having found this rule, apply it to the 
concrete example which was considered above. 

We want to differentiate the product 
(x 2 + c)x(ax* + b). 

Call (x* + c) = u; and (ax* + b) = v. 

Then, by the general rule just established, we 
may write : 

= O 2 + e) 4>ax? + (ax 4 + b)2x 

= 4<ax 5 + 4-acx s + 200c 5 + 2bx, 

§!-=6ax* + 4,acx s +2bx, 
dx 

exactlv as before. 



QUOTIENTS 39 

Lastly, we have to differentiate quotients. 

Think of this example, y = — ^— — . In such a case 

X + ct 

it is no use to try to work out the division beforehand, 
because x 2 + a will not divide into boo 5 + c, neither 
have they any common factor. So there is nothing 
for it but to go back to first principles, and find a 
rule. 

So we will put y = - ; 

* v 

where u and v are two different functions of the 

independent variable x. Then, when x becomes 

x+dx, y will become y+dy; and u will become 

u+du; and v will become v + dv. So then 

, 7 u+du 

Now perform the algebraic division, thus :

the second order, they may be neglected, and the

Would be of still smaller magnitudes.

the dividend function; then multiply the dividend

function; and subtract the latter product from, the 
former. Lastly, divide the difference by the square of

CHAPTER VII. 

SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENTIATION. 

Let us try the effect of repeating several times over 
the operation of differentiating a function (see p. 14). 
Begin with a concrete case. 
Let y = %*. 

First differentiation, 5a? 4 . 

Second differentiation, 5 x 4a? 3 = 20a? 3 . 

Third differentiation, 5 x 4 x Sx 2 = 60x 2 . 

Fourth differentiation, 5 x 4 x 3 x 2a? = 120a?. 

Fifth differentiation, 5x4x3x2x1 = 1 20. 

Sixth differentiation, = 0. 

There is a certain notation, with which we are 
already acquainted (see p. 15), used by some writers, 
that is very convenient. This is to employ the 
general symbol f(x) for any function of a?. Here 
the symbol f{ ) is read as "function of," without 
saying what particular function is meant. So the 
statement y=f(x) merely tells us that y is a function 
of x, it may be a? 2 or ax n , or cos a? or any other com- 
plicated function of x. 

The corresponding symbol for the differential co- 
efficient is f'(x), which is simpler to write than -~- 
This is called the "derived function " of x, 

O.M.B. D 



50 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

Suppose we differentiate over again, we shall get 
the " second derived function " or second differential 
coefficient, which is denoted i>yf"(x); and so on. 

Now let us generalize. 

Let y=f(x) = x n . 

First d iffer en t iat ion, f '(x) = nx n ~ \ 

Second differentiation, f'\x) = n{n — l)x n ~\ 

Third differentiation, f (x) = n(n-l)(n- 2)x n ~K 

Fourth differentiation, 

f""(x) = n(n-l)(n-2)(n-Z)x n -\ 
etc., etc. 

But this is not the only way of indicating successive 
differentiations. For, 
if the original function be y =/(x); 

once differentiating gives ~~ =f'(x) ; 

twice differentiating gives — j — =f"(x) ; 

and this is more conveniently written as , 1 \ 9 9 or 
more usually -r\. Similarly, we may write as the 
result of thrice differentiating, -j^i=f'"{x\

CHAPTER VIII. 

WHEN TIME VARIES. 

Some of the most important problems of the calculus 
are those where time is the independent variable, and 
we have to think about the values of some other 
quantity that varies when the time varies. Some 
things grow larger as time goes on ; some other things 
grow smaller. The distance that a train has travelled 
from its starting place goes on ever increasing as time 
goes on. Trees grow taller as the years go by. 
Which is growing at the greater rate; a plant 12 
inches high which in one month becomes 14 inches 
high, or a tree 12 feet high which in a year becomes 
14 feet high ? 

In this chapter we are going to make much use 
of the word rate. Nothing to do with poor-rate, or 
police-rate (except that even here the word suggests 
a .proportion — a ratio — so many pence in the pound). 
Nothing to do even with birth-rate or death-rate, 
though these words suggest so many births or deaths 
per thousand of the population. When a motor-car 
whizzes by us, we say : What a terrific rate ! When 
a spendthrift is flinging about his money, we remark 
that that young man is living at a prodigious rate. 



WHEN TIME VARIES 5a 

What do we mean by rate ? In both these cases we 
are making a mental comparison of something that is 
happening, and the length of time that it takes to 
happen. If the motor-car flies past us going 10 yards 
per second, a simple bit of mental arithmetic will 
show us that this is equivalent — while it lasts — to a 
rate of 600 yards per minute, or over 20 miles per 
hour. 

Now in what sense is it true that a speed of 
10 yards per second is the same as 600 yards 
per mixiute ? Ten yards is not the same as 600 yards, 
nor is one second the same thing as one minute. 
What we mean by saying that the rate is the same, 
is this: that the proportion borne between distance 
passed over and time taken to pass over it, is the 
same in both cases. 

Take another example. A man may have only 
a few pounds in his possession, and yet be able to 
spend money at the rate of millions a year — provided 
he goes on spending money at that rate for a few 
minutes only. Suppose you hand a shilling over 
the counter to pay for some goods ; and suppose the 
operation lasts exactly one second. Then, during 
that brief operation, you are parting with your money 
at the rate of 1 shilling per second, which is the 
same rate as £3 per minute, or £180 per hour, or 
£4320 per day, or £1,576,800 per year! If you have 
£10 in your pocket, you can go on spending money 
at the rate of a million a year for just 5£ minutes. 

It is said that Sandy had not been in London 



54 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

above five minutes when " bang went saxpence" If 
he were to spend money at that rate throughout a 
day of 12 hours, he would be spending 6 shillings an 
hour, or £3. 12s. per day, or £21. 12s. a week, not 
counting the Sawbath. 

Now try to put some of these ideas into differential 
notation. 

Let y in this case stand for money, and let t stand 
for time. 

If you are spending money, and the amount you 
spend in a short time dt be called dy> the rate of 

spending it will be -~ ; or, as regards saving, with a 
minus sign, as — ■—-, because then dy is a decrement, 

not an increment. But money is not a good example 
for the calculus, because it generally comes and goes 
by jumps, not by a continuous flow — you may earn 
£200 a year, but it does not keep running in al] 
day long in a thin stream ; it comes in only weekly, 
or monthly, or quarterly, in lumps: and your ex- 
penditure also goes out in sudden payments. 

A more apt illustration of the idea of a rate is 
furnished by the speed of a moving body. From 
London (Euston station) to Liverpool is 200 miles. 
If a train leaves London at 7 o'clock, and reaches 
Liverpool at 11 o'clock, you know that, since it has 
travelled 200 miles in 4 hours, its average rate must 
have been 50 miles per hour ; because -^p- = -^-°-. Here 
you are really making a mental comparison between 



WHEN TIME VARIES 55 

the distance passed over and the time taken to pass 
over it. You are dividing one by the other. If y is 
the whole distance, and t the whole time, clearly the 

average rate is ^. Now the speed was not actually 

constant all the way : at starting, and during the 
slowing up at the end of the journey, the speed was 
less. Probably at some part, when running down- 
hill, the speed was over 60 miles an hour. If, during 
any particular element of time dt, the corresponding 
element of distance passed over was dy, then at that 

part of the journey the speed was -^. The rate at 

which one quantity (in the present instance, distance) 
is changing in relation to the other quantity (in this 
case, time) is properly expressed, then, by stating the 
differential coefficient of one with respect to the other. 
A velocity, scientifically expressed, is the rate at which 
a very small distance in any given direction is being 
passed over ; and may therefore be written 

dy 

But if the velocity v is not uniform, then it must 
be either increasing or else decreasing. The rate at 
which a velocity is increasing is called the acceleration. 
If a moving body is, at any particular instant, gaining 
an additional velocity dv in an element of time dt, 
then the acceleration a at that instant may be written 

dv . 

a= dt'

or the acceleration is the second differential coefficient 
of the distance, with respect to time. Acceleration is 
expressed as a chancre of velocity in unit time, for 
instance, as being so many feet per second per second ; 
the notation used being feet -=- second 2 . 

When a railway train has just begun to move, its 
velocity v is small ; but it is rapidly gaining speed — it 
is being hurried up, or accelerated, by the effort of the 

dhi . 

engine. So its -j~ is large. When it has got up its 

top speed it is no longer being accelerated, so that 

d 11 

then -^ has fallen to zero. But when it nears its 

stopping place its speed begins to slow down; may, 
indeed, slow down very quickly if the brakes are put 
on, and during this period of deceleration or slackening 

di) d u 

of pace, the value of -^-, that is, of -^~,will be negative. 

To accelerate a mass m requires the continuous 
application of force. The force necessary to accelerate 
a mass is proportional to the mass, and it is also 
proportional to the acceleration which is being im- 
parted. Hence we may write for the force f, the 
expression f=ma; 



WHEN TIME VARIES 57 

dv 



or f =m di> 

The product of a mass by the speed at which it is 
going is called its momentum, and is in symbols mv. 
If we differentiate momentum with respect to time 

(a (Will}} 

we shall get ; for the rate of change of mo- 
mentum. But, since m is a constant quantity, this 
may be written m-j-, which we see above is the same 

as f. That is to say, force may be expressed either 
as mass times acceleration, or as rate of change of 
momentum. 

Again, if a force is employed to move something 
(against an equal and opposite counter-force), it does 
work] and the amount of work done is measured by 
the product of the force into the distance (in its 
own direction) through which its point of application 
moves forward. So if a force f moves forward 
through a length y, the work done (which we may 
call w) will be w=fxy; 

where we take f as a constant force. If the force 
varies at different parts of the range y, then we must 
find an expression for its value from point to point. 
If f be the force along the small element of length 
dy, the amount of work done will be fx dy. But as 
dy is only an element of length, only an element of 



58 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

work will be done. If we write w for work, then an 
element of work will be div ; and we have 

dw=fxdy; 
which may be written 

dw = ma* dy\ 

or dw==m-rjt*dy 

j dv , 

or aw = m-7j*dy. 

Further, we may transpose the expression and write 
dw _~ 

This gives us yet a third definition of force ; that 
if it is being used to produce a displacement in any 
direction, the force (in that direction) is equal to the 
rate at which work is being done per unit of length 
in that direction. In this last sentence the word 
rate is clearly not used in its time-sense, but in its 
meaning as ratio or proportion. 

Sir Isaac Newton, who was (along with Leibnitz) 
an inventor of the methods of the calculus, regarded 
all quantities that were varying as flowing ; and the 
ratio which we nowadays call the differential co- 
efficient he regarded as the rate of flowing, or the 
fluxion of the quantity in question. He did not use 
the notation of the dy and dx, and dt (this was due 
to Leibnitz), but had instead a notation of his own. 
If y was a quantity that varied, or "flowed," then his 
symbol for its rate of variation (or " fluxion") was 



WHEN TIME VARIES 59 

#. If x was the variable, then its fluxion was called 
x. The dot over the letter indicated that it had been 
differentiated. But this notation does not tell us 
what is the independent variable with respect to 
which the differentiation has been effected. When 

we see -~ we know that y is to be differentiated with 
dt y 

respect to t. If we see -j- we know that y is to be 

differentiated with respect to x. But if we see merely 
y, we cannot tell without looking at the context 

whether this is to mean -y^ or -f- or -f-, or what is 

ax at az 

the other variable. So, therefore, this fluxional no- 
tation is less informing than the differential notation, 
and has in consequence largely dropped out of use. 
But its simplicity gives it an advantage if only we 
will agree to use it for those cases exclusively where 
time is the independent variable. In that case y will 

dy t . .,, du j .. .„ d 2 x 

mean -£ and u will mean -^- : and x will mean -y^-. 
dt dt dt 1 

Adopting this fluxional notation we may write the 

mechanical equations considered in the paragraph* 

above, as follows :

Examples. 

(1) A body moves so that the distance x (in feet), 
which it travels from a certain point 0, is given by 
the relation a? = 0*2£ 2 + 10*4, where t is the time in 
seconds elapsed since a certain instant. Find the 
velocity and acceleration 5 seconds after the body 
began to move, and also find the corresponding values 
when the distance covered is 100 feet. Find also 
the average velocity during the first 10 seconds of 
its motion. (Suppose distances and motion to the 
right to be positive.) 

Now x = 0*2^ + 10-4, 

v = x = -j7 = 0*4£; and a = x — —r^ — 0*4 = constant. 
at dt 2 

When £ = 0, x = 10*4 and v = 0. The body started 
from a point 10*4 feet to the right of the point O: 
and the time was reckoned from the instant the 
body started. 

When t = 5, <*- = 0*4x5 = 2 ft./sec; a = 0-4 f t./sec 2 . 

When x = 100, 100 = 0'2t 2 + 10*4, or £ 2 = 448, 
mnd t = 21-17 sec. ; v = 0*4 x 21*17 = 8*468 ft./sec. 

When £=10, 

distance travelled = 0'2 x 10 2 + 10*4 - 10*4 = 20 ft. 
Average velocity = -j# = 2 ft./sec. 

(It is the same velocity as the velocity at the middle 
of the interval, t = 5; for, the acceleration being con- 
stant, the velocity has varied uniformly from zero 
when t = to 4 ft./sec. when t = !0.) 



WHEN TIME VARIES 61 

(2) In the above problem let us suppose 

x = 0-2t 2 + St+ 10-4. 

fjfnf* (H^X 

v=% = — '—. = 0*4£+ 3 ; a = x — - 7jt9 = 0*4 = constant. 
at at 1 

When t = 0, a? = 10*4 and v = S ft./sec., the time is 
reckoned from the instant at which the body passed a 
point 10*4 ft. from the point O, its velocity being then 
already 3 ft./sec. To find the time elapsed since it began 
moving, let # = 0; then 0*4£ + 3 = 0, t= — | = — 7*5 sec. 
The body began moving 7*5 sec. before time was 
begun to be observed; 5 seconds after this gives 
t = - 2-5 and v = 0-4 x - 2*5 + 3 = 2 ft./sec. 

When a? = 100 ft., 

100 = 0-2« 2 + 3« + 10-4; or £ 2 + 15*-448 = 0; 
hence t = 1 4*95 sec, v = 0*4 x 1 495 + 3 = 8*98 ft./sec. 

To find the distance travelled during the 10 first 
seconds of the motion one must know how far the 
body was from the point O when it started. 

When «=-7-5, 

# = 0-2x(-7-5) 2 -3x7-5 + 10-4=-0-85ft„ 
that is 0*85 ft. to the left of the point O. 

Now, when £ = 2\5, 

x = 2 x25 2 + 3x 2*5 + 10-4 = 19-15. 

So, in 10 seconds, the distance travelled was 
19-15 + 0-85 = 20 ft., and 

the average velocity = -f£ = 2 ft./sec. 

(3) Consider a similar problem when the distance 
is given by x = 0'2t 2 -M + 104. Then ^ = 0*4^-3, 
tg = 0*4 = constant. When t = 0, x = 1 0*4 as before, and 



62 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

v = — 3 ; so that the body was moving in the direction 
opposite to its motion in the previous cases. As the 
acceleration is positive, however, we see that this 
velocity will decrease as time goes on, until it becomes 
zero, when v = or 04£— 3 = 0; or t = 7'5 sec. After 
this, the velocity becomes positive; and 5 seconds 
after the body started, £=12*5, and 

v = 0-4 X 1 2*5 - 3 = 2 f t./sec. 
When a? = 100, 
100 = 0-2£ 2 -3£ + 10'4, or J 2 -15£-448 = 0, 
and t = 29*95 ; v = 0*4 x 29'95 - 3 = 8'98 ft./sec. 

When v is zero, a? = 0-2 x 7o 2 -3 x 7*5 + 10-4= -0*85, 
informing us that the body moves back to 0*85 ft. 
beyond the point O before it stops. Ten seconds later 

£=17'5 and x = 02 x 17'5 2 -3 x 17*5 + 10-4= 19*15. 
The distance travelled = '85 + 1915 = 20*0, and the 
average velocity is again t ft./sec. 

(4) Consider yet another problem of the same sort 
with x = 0'2t 3 - St 2 + 10-4; v = 0'6t*-6t; a = l'2t-6. 
The acceleration is no more constant. 

When t=>0, # = 10-4, v = 0, a= -6. The body is 
at rest, buo just ready to move with a negative 
acceleration, that is to gain a velocity towards the 
point O. 

(5) If we have ^ = 0-2^-3^+10-4, then v = 0'6t 2 -3, 
and a=l'2t. 

When £ = 0, a? = 10*4; v=—S; a = (?.

a velocity of 3 ft. /sec, and just at that instant the 
velocity is uniform. 

We see that the conditions of the motion can always 
be at once ascertained from the time-distance equation 
and its first and second derived functions. In the 
last two cases the mean velocity during the first 
10 seconds and the velocity 5 seconds after the start 
will no more be the same, because the velocity is not 
increasing uniformly, the acceleration being no longer 
constant.

(a) after 1 second ; (b) after it has performed one 
revolution. At what time is it at rest, and how many 
revolutions has it performed up to that instant ? 

Writing for the acceleration 

ft, = = ^ = 2-O-3£ 2 , a = S = ^=-0-6fc 

When t = 0, = 3; oo = 2 rad./sec; a = 0. 
When Z=l, 

co = 2 - 0-3 = 1 -7 rad./sec. ; a = - 0*6 rad./sec 2 . 
This is a retardation ; the wheel is slowing down. 
After 1 revolution 

= 2tt=6'28; 6-28 = 3 + 2*-0'U 3 . 
By plotting the graph, d = 3 + 2t — Q'lft, we can get 
the value or values of t for which = 6*28; these 
are 2*11 and 3*03 (there is a third negative value).

CHAPTER X. 

GEOMETEICAL MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION. 

It is useful to consider what geometrical meaning can 
be given to the differential coefficient. 

In the first place, any function of x, such, for 
example, as x 2 , or s/x, or ax+b, can be plotted as 
a curve; and nowadays every schoolboy is familiar 
with the process of curve-plotting. 




Let PQR, in Fig. 7, be a portion of a curve plotted 
with respect to the axes of coordinates OX and OY, 
Consider any point Q on this curve, where the 
abscissa of the point is x and its ordinate is y. 
Now observe how y changes when x is varied. If x 



MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 77 

is made to increase by a small increment dx, to the 
right, it will be observed that y also (in this particular 
curve) increases by a small increment dy (because this 
particular curve happens to be an ascending curve). 
Then the ratio of dy to dx is a measure of the degree 
to which the curve is sloping up between the two 
points Q and T. As a matter of fact, it can be seen 
on the figure that the curve between Q and T has 
many different slopes, so that we cannot very well 
speak of the slope of the curve between Q and T. If, 
however, Q and T are so near each other that the 
small portion QT of the curve is practically straight, 

then it is true to say that the ratio -~ t is the slope of 

the curve along QT. The straight line QT produced 
on either side touches the curve along the portion QT 
only, and if this portion is indefinitely small, the 
straight line will touch the curve at practically 
one point only, and be therefore a tangent to the 
curve. 

This tangent to the curve has evidently the same 

slope as QT, so that -~ is the slope of the tangent to 

du 

the curve at the point Q for which the value of ~f^ is 
„ n ctx 

tound. 

We have seen that the short expression " the slope 

of a curve " has no precise meaning, because a curve 

has so many slopes — in fact, every small portion of a 

curve has a different slope. " The slope of a curve at 

a point " is. however, a perfectly defined thing ; it is 



78 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



the slope of a very small portion of the curve situated 
just at that point; and we have seen that this is the 
same as " the slope of the tangent to the curve at that 
point." 

Observe that dx is a short step to the right, and 
dy the corresponding short step upwards. These 
steps must be considered as short as possible — in fact 
indefinitely short, — though in diagrams we have to 
represent them by bits that are not infinitesimally 
small, otherwise they could not be seen. 

We shall hereafter make considerable use of this 

circumstance that -i- represents the slope of the curv6 
at any point

If a curve is sloping up at 45° at a particular point,

negative value; hence -~- will have negative sign 
also. 

If the "curve" happens to be a straight line, like 

flu 

that in Fig. 12, the value of -^ will be the same at 

all points along it. In other words its slope is constant. 




FIG. 12. 



If a curve is one that turns more upwards as it 
goes along to the right, the values of -~ will become 




Fig. 13. 



greater and greater with the increasing steepness, as 
in Fig. 13. 



MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 81 



If a curve is one that gets flatter and flatter as it 
goes along, the values of -~- will become smaller and 
smaller as the flatter part is reached, as in Fig. 14 





Fig. 14. 



Fig. 15. 



If a curve first descends, and then goes up again, 
as in Fig. 15, presenting a concavity upwards, then 

clearly ,-- will first hi. negative, with diminishing 

values as the curve flattens, then will be zero at the 
point where the bottom of the trough of the curve is 

reached ; and from this point onward -^ will have 

positive values that go on increasing. In such a case y 
is said to pass through a minimum. The minimum 
value of y is not necessarily the smallest value of y 7 
it is that value of y corresponding to the bottom of 
the trough; for instance, in Fig. 28 (p. 101), the 
value of y corresponding to the bottom of the trough 
ie 1, while y takes elsewhere values which are smaller 
than this. The characteristic of a minimum is that 
y must increase on either side of it. 



82 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



N.B. — For the particular value of x that makes 
y ,x minimum, the value of ' = 0. 

If a curve first ascends and then descends, the 

values of ~- will be positive at first; then zero, as 

th : , summit is reached ; then negative, as the curve 
sic pes downwards, as in Fig. 16. In this case i/.is 
said to pass through a maximum, but the maximum 
value of y is not necessarily the greatest value of y. 
In Fig. 28, the maximum of y is 2 J, but this is by no 
means the greatest value y can have at some other 
point of the curve.

If a curve has the particular form of Fig. 17, the 

values of ~J^ will always be positive ; but there will 

be one particular place where the slope is least steep, 

where the value of -^- will be a minimum ; that, is, 
ax 

less than it is at any other part of the curve. 



MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 83 

civ 
If a curve has the form of Fig. 18, the value of -—; 

will be negative in the upper part, and positive in the 
lower part; while at the nose of the curve where it 

(Hit 

becomes actually perpendicular, the value of -^ will 

be infinitely great. 




Fig. 18. 



dy 



Now that we understand that -^ measures the 

ax 

steepness of a curve at any point, let us turn to some 

of the equations which we have already learned how 

to differentiate. 

(1) As the simplest case take this : 
y = x+b. 

It is plotted out in Fig. 19, using equal scales 
for x and y. if we put x = 0, then the corresponding 
ordinate will be y = b] that is to say, the " curve " 
crosses the y-axis at the height b. From here it 



84 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



ascends at 45° ; for whatever values we give to a? to 
the right, we have an equal y to ascend. The line 
has a gradient of 1 in 1. 

Now differentiate y = x+b, by the rules we have 

already learned (pp. 22 and 26 ante), and we get -^- = 1. 

The slope of the line is such that for every little 
step dx to the right, we go an equal little step dy 
upward. And this slope is constant — always the 
same slope. 




Fig. 19. 



Fig. 20. 



(2) Take another case : 

y = ax+b. 
We know that this curve, like the preceding one, will 
start from a height b on the «/-axis. But before we 
draw the curve, let us find its slope by differentiating; 

which gives us -^- — a. The slope will be constant, at 

lin angle, the tangent of which is here called a. Let 
as assign to a some numerical value — say \. Then we 
nmst give it such a slope that it ascends 1 in 3 ; or 



MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 85 

dx will be 3 times as great as dy ; as magnified in 
Fig. 21. So, draw the line in Fig. 20 at this slope. 




Fig. 21. 

(3) Now for a slightly harder case. 

Let y = ax 2 + b. 

Again the curve will start on the ?/-axis at a height 
b above the origin. 

Now differentiate. [If you have forgotten, turn 
back to p. 26 ; or, rather, dont turn back, but think 
out the differentiation.] 

dy 



dx 



= 2ax. 




This shows that the steepness will not be constant: 
it increases as x increases. At the starting point P t 



86 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



where x = 0, the curve (Fig. 22) has no steepness 
— that is, it is level. On the left of the origin, where 

x has negative values, -^- will also have negative 

CtX 

values, or will descend from left to right, as in the 
Figure. 

Let us illustrate this by working out a particular 
instance. Taking the equation 

and differentiating it, we get 
dx 



■\x. 



Now assign a few successive values, say from to 
5, to x ; and calculate the corresponding values of y 

by the first equation; and of -^- from the second

Then plot them out in two curves, Figs. 23 and 24 
in Fig. 23 plotting the values of y against those of x. 

and in Fig. 24 those of -^- against those of x. For 



MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 8T 

any assigned value of x, the height of the ordinate 
in the second curve is proportional to the slope of the 
first curve.

The following examples show further applications 
of the principles just explained. 

(4) Find the slope of the tangent to the curve 

at the point where x = — 1. Find the angle which thia 
tangent makes with the curve y = 2x 2 + 2. 

The slope of the tangent is the slope of the curve at 
the point where they touch one another (see p. 77): 

that is, it is the — of the curve for that point. Here 

-t^=—7t-o and for x= — 1, -,•=—«, which is the 
dx 2x 2 dx 2 

slope of the tangent and of the curve at that point. 

The tangent, being a straight line, has for equation 

y — ax + 6, and its slope is ~ = a, hence a = — ~. Also 

if x=—l, y = -fr, — tT + 3 = 21; an( j as the tangent 

passes by this point, the coordinates of the point must 
satisfy the equation of the tangent, namely 

y=--x + b, 

so that 2J=— ^x( — 1) + 6 and 6 = 2; the equation of 

z 1 

the tangent is therefore y= — ^x + 2. 

Now, when two curves meet, the intersection being 
a point common to both curves, its coordinates must 
satisfy the equation of each one of the two curves; 



MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 89 

that is, it must be a solution of the system of simul- 
taneous equations formed by coupling together the 
equations of the curves. Here the curves meet one 
another at points given by the solution of 

\y=_£a.+2 or 2a; 2 + 2=-i#+2; 

that is, x(2x + J) = 0. 

This equation has for its solutions x = and x = — £• 
The slope of the curve y = 2x 2 +2 at any point is 

-~ = 4>x. 
ax 

For the point where x = 0, this slope is zero; the curve 

is horizontal. For the point where 

__ 1 dy _ . 

hence the curve at that point slopes downwards to 
the right at such an angle 9 with the horizontal that 
tan = 1; that is, at 45° to the horizontal. 

The slope of the straight line is — h ; that is, it slopes 
downwards to the right and makes with the horizontal 
an angle <f> such that tan^ = J; that is, an angle of 
26° 34'. It follows that at the first point the curve 
cuts the straight line at an angle of 26° 34', while at 
the second it cuts it at an angle of 45° — 26° 34/ = 18" 26'. 

(5) A straight line is to be drawn, through a point 
whose coordinates are a? = 2, y= —1, as tangent to the 
curve ?/ = x 2 — 5x+6. Find the coordinates of the 
point of contact. 



90 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

The slope of the tangent must be the same as the 

~ of the curve ; that is, 2x — 5. 

The equation of the straight line is y = ax+b, and 
as it is satisfied for the values x = 2, y=—l, then 

— l = ax2 + 6; also, its -^ = a = 2x — 5. 

The x and the y of the point of contact must also 
satisfy both the equation of the tangent and the 
equation of the curve. 
We have then 

y = x 2 — 5x + 6, .. (i) 

y = ax+b, o (ii) 

-l = 2a + 6, (iii) 

a = 2x — 5, (iv) 

four equations in a, b, x, y. 

Equations (i) and (ii) give oc? — 5x + 6 = ax+b. 
Replacing a and b by their value in this, we get 

x 2 -5x+6 = (2x-5)x-l-2(2x-5), 

which simplifies to x 2 — 4a?+3 = 0, the solutions of 
which are: x = S and x = l. Replacing in (i), we get 
y = and y — 2 respectively ; the two points of contact 
are then x = 1, y = 2 ; and x = 3, y = 0. 

Note. — In all exercises dealing with curves, students 
will find it extremely instructive to verify the deduc- 
tions obtained by actually plotting the curves.

CHAPTER XL 



MAXIMA AND MINIMA. 

A QUANTITY which varies continuously is said to 
pass by (or through) a maximum or minimum value 
when, in the course of its variation, the immediately 
preceding and following values are both smaller or 
greater, respectively, than the value referred to. An 
infinitely great value is therefore not a maximum 
value. 

One of the principal uses 
of the process of differen- 
tiating is to find out under 
what conditions the value 
of the thing differentiated 
becomes a maximum, or a 
minimum. This is often ex- 
ceedingly important in en- 
gineering questions, where 
it is most desirable to 
know what conditions will make the cost of working 
a minimum, or will make the efficiency a maximum. 

Now, to begin with a concrete case, let us take the 
equation y = x 2 —4*x + 7. 

By assigning a number of successive values to x, 
and finding the corresponding values of y, we can

readily see that the equation represents a curve with 
& minimum.

These values are plotted in Fig. 26, which shows 
that y has apparently a minimum value of 3, when x 
is made equal to 2. But are you sure that the 
minimum occurs at 2, and not at 2\ or at If ? 

Of course it would be possible with any algebraic 
expression to work out a lot of values, and in this 
way arrive gradually at the particular value that 
may be a maximum or a minimum.

Here is another example : 
Let y = 3%— x\

MAXIMA AND MINIMA 98 

Plot these values as in Fig. 27. 

It will be evident that there will be a maximum 
somewhere between x = l and x = 2; and the thing 
looks as if the maximum value of y ought to be 
about 2 J. Try some intermediate values. If x = l\, 
y = 2187; if x=l$, y = 2 25; if # = 1*6, */ = 2*24. 
How can we be sure that 2*25 is the real maximum, 
or that it occurs exactly when x = 1 \ ? 

Now it may sound like juggling to be assured that 
there is a way by which one can arrive straight at a 
maximum (or minimum) value without making a lot of 
preliminary trials or guesses. And that way depends 
on differentiating. Look back to an earlier page (81) for 
the remarks about Figs. 14 and 15, and you will see 
that whenever a curve gets either to its maximum 

{in 

or to its minimum height, at that point its -^ = 0. 

Now this gives us the clue to the dodge that is 
wanted. When there is put before you an equation, 
and you want to find that value of x that will make 
its y a minimum (or a maximum), first differentiate 

it, and having done so, write its J* as equal to zero, 

and then solve for x. Put this particular value of x 
into the original equation, and you will then get the 
required value of y. This process is commonly called 
" equating to zero." 

To see how simply it works, take the example with 
which this chapter opens, namely 
y=x 2 — 4a?-j-7, 



96 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

Differentiating, we get : 

ax 

Now equate this to zero, thus : 

2#-4 = 0. 
Solving this equation for x, we get : 
2^=4, 
x = 2. 
Now, we know that the maximum (or minimum) 
Will occur exactly when a? =2. 

Putting the value x = 2 into the original equation, 
we get 2/ = 2 2 -(4x2) + 7 

=4-8+7 
= 3. 
Now look back at Fig 26, and you will see that the 
minimum occurs when x = 2, and that this minimum 
afy = 3. 

Try the second example (Fig. 24), which is 
y = 3x— X*. 

Differentiating, ^ = 3-2#. 

Equating to zero, 

3-2# = 0, 
whence x=*l%; 

and putting this value of x into the original equation, 
we find: y = 4i-(l*Xli), 

This gives us exactly the information as to which 
the method of trying a lot of values left us uncertain. 



MAXIMA AND MINIMA 97 

Now, before we go on to any further cases, we have 
two remarks to make. When you are told to equate 

-^- to zero, you feel at first (that is if you have any 
wits of your own) a kind of resentment, because you 

know that -^- has all sorts of different values at 
ax 

different parts of the curve, according to whether it 

is sloping up or down. So, when you are suddenly 

told to write ^ y 

d^ = °' 

you resent it, and feel inclined to say that it can't be 
true. Now you will have to understand the essential 
difference between "an equation," and "an equation 
of condition." Ordinarily you are dealing with equa- 
tions that are true in themselves, but, on occasions, 
of which the present are examples, you have to write 
down equations that are not necessarily true, but are 
only true if certain conditions are to be fulfilled ; and 
you write them down in order, by solving them, to 
find the conditions which make them true Now we 
want to find the particular value that x has when 
the curve is neither sloping up nor sloping down, that 

is, at the particular place where -p = 0. So, writing 

~t = does not mean that it always is = ; but you 

write it down as a condition in order to see how

much x will come out Jf — K is to be zero,

98 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

The second remark is one which (if you have any 
wits of your own) you will probably have already 
made: namely, that this much-belauded process of 
equating to zero entirely fails to tell you whether 
the x that you thereby find is going to give you 
a maximum value of y or a minimum value of y. 
Quite so. It does not of itself discriminate; it finds 
for you the right value of x but leaves you to find 
out for yourselves whether the corresponding y is a 
maximum or a minimum. Of course, if you have 
plotted the curve, you know already which it will be. 

For instance, take the equation : 

Without stopping to think what curve it corre- 
sponds to, differentiate it, and equate to zero : 

^ = 4-ar 2 = 4-- 2 =0; 

ax x 2, 9 

whence & = $! 

and, inserting this value, 

will be either a maximum or else a minimum. But 
which ? You will hereafter be told a way, depending 
upon a second differentiation, (see Chap. XII., p. 112). 
But at present it is enough if you will simply try 
any other value of x differing a little from the one 
found, and see whether with this altered value the 
corresponding value of y is less or greater than that 
already found. 



MAXIMA AND MINIMA 99 

Try another simple problem in maxima and minima. 
Suppose you were asked to divide any number into 
two parts, such that the product was a maximum? 
How would you set about it if you did not know 
the trick of equating to zero ? I suppose you could 
worry it out by the rule of try, try, try again. Let 
60 be the number. You can try cutting it into two 
parts, and multiplying them together. Thus, 50 times 
10 is 500; 52 times 8 is 416; 40 times 20 is 800; 45 
times 15 is 675; 30 times 30 is 900. This looks like 
a maximum : try varying it. 31 times 29 is 899, 
which is not so good; and 32 times 28 is 896, which 
is worse. So it seems that the biggest product will 
be got by dividing into two equal halves. 

Now see what the calculus tells you. Let the 
number to be cut into two parts be called n. Then 
if x is one part, the other will be n — x, and the product 
will be x(n — x) or nx — x 2 . So we write y = nx—x 2 . 
Now differentiate and equate to zero ; 

^- = n-2x = 0. 
ax 

Solving for x, we get ^ = x. 

So now we know that whatever number n may be, 
we must divide it into two equal parts if the product 
of the parts is to be a maximum; and the value of 
that maximum product will always be = in 2 . 

This is a very useful rule, and appliec to any number 
of factors, so that if m+n+p = a, constant number, 
mxnxp is a maximum when m = n = p.

Test Case. 

Let us at once apply our knowledge to a case that 
we can test. 
Let y = x 2 —x; 

and let us find whether this function has a maximum 
or minimum ; and if so, test whether it is a maximum 
or a minimum. 

Differentiating, we get 

f=2x-<L 
ax 

Equating to zero, we get 

2#-l = 0, 

whence 2# = 1, 

or #==!• 

That is to say, when x is made = \, the corresponding 
value of y will be either a maximum or a minimum. 
Accordingly, putting x = \ in the original equation- we 

s et y=a) 2 -h 

or 2/=-i 

Is this a maximum or a minimum ? To test it, try 
putting x a little bigger than %, — say make x = 0d 

Then y = (0*6) 2 - 0'6 = 0*36 - 0'6 = - 0-24, 

which is higher up than — 0*25 ; showing that 
y = — 0*25 is a minimum. 

Plot the curve for yourself, and verify the cal- 
culation.

Further Examples. 

A most interesting example is afforded by a curve 
that has both a maximum and a minimum. Its 
equation is : y = ix 3 - 2x 2 + Sx + 1.

Now

Equating to zero, we get the quadratic, 
x 2 -±x + 3 = 0) 
and solving the quadratic gives us two roots, viz, 
(x = 3 
\x = l. 
Now, when a? = 3, y = l; and when x=l, y — 2\. 
The first of these is a minimum, the second a 
maximum. 

The curve itself may be plotted (as in Fig. 28)

A further exercise in maxima and minima is 
afforded by the following example : 

r lhe equation to a circle of radius r, having its 
centre O at the point whose coordinates .are x = a, 
y = b, as depicted in Fig. 29, is : 

(y-b) 2 +(x-a) 2 =r 2 - 
This may be transformed into 

y = s/r 2 — (x — a) 2 +b. 




Now we know beforehand, by mere inspection of 
the figure, that when x = a, y will be either at its 
maximum value, b+r, or else at its minimum 
value, 6— r. But let us not take advantage of this 



MAXIMA AND MINIMA 103 

knowledge; let us set about finding what value 
of x will make y a maximum or a minimum, by the 
process of differentiating and equating to zero. 

dy ^ 1 x(2a—2a?), 

dx 2 s /r' i —(x — a) 2 

which reduces to 

dy q— x 

dx" Jri-ix-a) 2 

Then the condition for y being maximum or 
minimum is: 

a—x 



vr 2 -(a;-a) 2 



=0. 



Since no value whatever of x will make the de- 
nominator infinite, the only condition to give zero is 

x = a. 

Inserting this value in the original equation for 
the circle, we find 

y = s/r*+b; 

and as the root of r 2 is either +r or — r f we have 
two resulting values of y, 

fy = b+r 
\y = b-r 

The first of these is the maximum, at the top; 
the second the minimum, at the bottom. 



104 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

If the curve is such that there is no place that is a 
maximum or minimum, the process of equating to 
zero will yield an impossible result. For instance : 

Let y = ax?+bx+c. 

Then ^=r-3ax 2 +b. 

ax 

Equating this to zero, we get 3ax 2 + b = 0, x 2 = -~ 9 
and x = yJ— — , which is impossible, supposing a and 6 

to have the same sign. 

Therefore y has no maximum nor minimum. 

A few more worked examples will enable you to 
thoroughly master this most interesting and useful 
application of the calculus. 

(1) What are the sides of the rectangle of maximum 
area inscribed in a circle of radius R ? 

If one side be called x, 

the other side = ^(diagonal) 2 — x 2 ; 
and as the diagonal of the rectangle is necessarily a

Then, area of rectangle S = X\/4<R 2 —x 2 ,

The other side = Jm* - 2 jB 2 = J? J 2 ; the two sides 
are equal ; the figure is a square the side of which is 
equal to the diagonal of the square constructed on the 
radius. In this case it is, of course, a maximum with 
which we are dealing. 

(2) What is the radius of the opening of a conical

the capacity of the vessel is greatest ? 

If R be the radius and H the corresponding height,

two solutions. 

Taking first x = 0. If x = -0'5, y = 025 ± ^Z^ 1 ^ 5 , 
and if a? =+0*5, y = 0'25±s/( 9 5) 5 . On one side y is 
imaginary ; that is, there is no value of y that can be 
represented by a graph ; the latter is therefore entirely 
on the right side of the axis of y (see Fig. 30). 

On plotting the graph it will be found that the 



108 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



curve goes to the origin, as if there were a minimum 
there ; but instead of continuing beyond, as it should 
do for a minimum, it retraces its steps (forming what 
is called a " cusp "). There is no minimum, therefore, 
although the condition for a minimum is satisfied, 

namely y^ = 0. It is necessary therefore always to 

check by taking one value on either side.

CURVATURE OF CURVES. 

B.ETURNING to the process of successive differentia- 
tion, it may be asked: Why does anybody want to 
differentiate twice over ? We know that when the 
variable quantities are space and time, by differ- 
entiating twice over we get the acceleration of a 
moving body, and that in the geometrical interpreta- 

Y| -Y] 





Fig. 31. 



Fig. 32. 



dy 



tion, as applied to curves, -^- means the slope of the 

dht 
curve. But what can -r-^ mean in this case ? Clearly 

it means the rate (per unit of length x) at which the 
slope is changing — in brief, it is an indication of the 
manner in which the slope of the portion of curve 
considered varies, that is, whether the slope of the 
curve increases or decreases when x increases, or, in 



CURVATURE OF CURVES 



113 



other words, whether the curve curves up or down 
towards the right 

Suppose a slope constant, as in Fig. 31. 

Here, -¥■ is of constant value. 

9 ax 

Suppose, however, a case in which, like Fig. 32, 
the slope itself is getting greater upwards; then 



d(&\ 



— 7-^-, that is, -tK„ will be positive. 
dx ax 1 r 

If the slope is becoming less as you go to the 

right (as in Fig. 14, p. 81), or as in Fig. 33, then, 

even though the curve may be 

going upward, since the change 

is such as to diminish its slope, 

its -T-4 will b e negative. 

It is now time to initiate 
you into another secret — how 
to tell whether the result that 
you get by " equating to zero " 
is a maximum or a minimum. The trick is this : After 
you have differentiated (so as to get the expression 
which you equate to zero), you then differentiate a 
second time, and look whether the result of the second 

differentiation is positive or negative. If -=-^ comes 

ctx 

out positive, then you know that the value of y 
which you got was a minimum; but if -^ comes 




Fig. 33. 



114 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



out negative, then the value of y which you got must 
be a maximum. That's the rule. 

The reason of it ought to be quite evident. Think 
of any curve that has a minimum point in it, like

minimum y is marked M, and the curve is concave 
upwards. To the left of M the slope is downward, 
that is, negative, and is getting less negative. To the 
right of M the slope has become upward, and is

getting more and more upward. Clearly the change 
of slope as the curve passes through M is such that 

(J ii 

-r-^ is positive, for its operation, as x increases toward 

the right, is to convert a downward slope into an 
upward one. 

Similarly, consider any curve that has a maximum 
point in it, like Fig. 16 (p. 82), or like Fig. 35, where 
the curve is convex, and the maximum point is 
marked Jf. In this case, as the curve passes through 
M from left to right, its upward slope is converted

case the " slope of the slope " -r-^ is negative.

whether in any particular case there is a maximum 
or a minimum. You will find below a few worked

y=cc?-2x+l6.

-r^ = 6x ; for x = 1 ; it is + ; 

hence x—1 corresponds to a minimum y=14. For 
x= — 1 it is — ; hence x= — 1 corresponds to a maxi-

Partial Fractions. 

We have seen that when we differentiate a fraction 
we have to perform a rather complicated operation; 
and, if the fraction is not itself a simple one, the result 
is bound to be a complicated expression. If we could 
split the fraction into two or more simpler fractions 
such that their sum is equivalent to the original 
fraction, we could then proceed by differentiating 
each of these simpler expressions. And the result of 
differentiating would be the sum of two (or more) 
differentials, each one of which is relatively simple; 
while the final expression, though of course it will be 
the same as that which could be obtained without 
resorting to this dodge, is thus obtained with much 
less effort and appears in a simplified form. 

Let us see how to reach this result. Try first the 
job of adding two fractions together to form a resultant 

fraction. Take, for example, the two fractions =- 

2 X+ 

and -• Every schoolboy can add these together 

X ~ . 3#+l 

and find their sum to be —5 — =-• And in the same 

ar — 1 



122 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

way he can add together three or more fractions. 
Now this process can certainly be reversed : that is to 
say that, if this last expression were given, it is certain 
that it can somehow be split back again into its 
original components or partial fractions. Only we do 
not know in every case that may be presented to us 
how we can so split it. In order to find this out 
we shall consider a simple case at first. But it is 
important to bear in mind that all which follows 
applies only to what are called "proper" algebraic 
fractions, meaning fractions like the above, which have 
the numerator of a lesser degree than the denominator ; 
that is, those in which the highest index of x is less 
in the numerator than in the denominator. If we 

have to deal with such an expression as -~g — =■ , we can 

simplify it by division, since it is equivalent to 

3 8 

l + ~2 — =•; and — — - is a proper algebraic fraction 

3L — ~ X X "" — A 

to which the operation of splitting into partial fractions 
can be applied, as explained hereafter. 

Case I. If we perform many additions of two or 
more fractions the denominators of which contain only 
terms in x, and no terms in x 2 , it* 3 , or any other powers 
of x, we always find that the denominator of the final 
resulting fraction is the product of the denominators 
of the fractions which were added to form the result. 
It follows that by factorizing the denominator of this 
final fraction, we can find every one of the denomina- 
tors of the partial fractions of which we are in search.

Suppose we wish to go back from — % — ^ to the

components which we know are — —=■ and T « If 

r x+1 x—1 

we did not know what those components were we can 

CDtill prepare the way by writing : 

x 2 -l~ (x+l){x-l)~ x+l + x-V 

leaving blank the places for the numerators until we 
know what to put there. We always may assume the 
sign between the partial fractions to be plus, since, if 
it be minus, we shall simply find the corresponding 
numerator to be negative. Now, since the partial 
fractions are proper fractions, the numerators are 
mere numbers without x at all, and we can call them 
A, B, C ... as we please. So, in this case, we have: 
3^ + 1^ A B 

If, now, we perform the addition of these two 
partial fractions, we get — , iv — t\ — > an( ^ this 

must be equal to - — , ( =-r. And, as the de- 

nominators in these two expressions are the same, 
the numerators must be equal, giving us : 

3x+l = A(x-l)+B(x + l). 

Now, this is an equation with two unknown 
quantities, and it would seem that we need another 
equation before we can solve them and find A and 2?. 



124 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

But there is another way out of this difficulty. The 
equation must be true for all values of x\ therefore 
it must be true for such values of x as will cause 
x—1 and x+l to become zero, that is for x = l and 
for x=—l respectively. If we make x = l, we get 
4 = (ixO)+(J?x2), so that B=2; and if we make 
a?=-l,weget-2 = (,lx-2) + (SxO),sothatA = l. 
Replacing the A and B of the partial fractions by 

these new values, we find them to become --r and 

2 . . X + 
=- ; and the thing is done. 

X -— JL 

As a further example, let us take the fraction 

4^*2 _l 2#?— 14 

The denominator becomes zero when 



x?+3x 2 -x-S 
x is given the value 1 ; hence x — 1 is a factor of it, 
and obviously then the other factor will be x 2 + 4a? + 3 ; 
and this can again be decomposed into (a?+l)(a? + 3). 
So we may write the fraction thus : 

4x 2 + 2x-U _ A JB_ G 



x* + 3x 2 — x — 3 x + l x—1 x+S 
making three partial factors. 
Proceeding as before, we find 
4>x 2 +2x-U = A(x-l)(x + 3) + B(x + l)(x+3) 

+ C(x + l)(x-l). 
Now, if we make x=l, we get : 
-8 = (AxO)+I?(2x4) + (CxO); that is, B = - 1. 
If x— — -1, we get 
-12 = 4(-2x2) + (jSxO) + (CxO); whence A=3. 



OTHER USEFUL DODGES 125 

If x = — 3, we get: 

16 = (^xO) + (J5xO) + C(-2x-4); whence (7=2. 

So then the partial fractions are : 

J}_ L_+_ 2 

x+1 x — l x+3' 

which is far easier to differentiate with raspect to x 
than the complicated expression from which it is 
derived. 

Case II. If some of the factors of the denominator 
contain terms in x 2 , and are not conveniently put 
into factors, then the corresponding numerator may 
contain a term in x, as well as a simple number, and 
hence it becomes necessary to represent this unknown 
numerator not by the symbol A but by Ax+B; the 
rest of the calculation being made as before. 

Try, for instance : ^^^j-. 

-x 2 -3 Ax+B C . 

(x 2 +l)(x+l)~~ x 2 +l + x+V 

-x 2 -3 = (Ax+B)(x+l)+C(x 2 +l). 

Putting a?=— 1, we get — 4 = C r x2; and (7= —2; 
hence -a?-S = (Ax + B)(x+l)-2a?-2; 
and x 2 -l=Ax(x+\) + B{x+l). 

Putting x = 0, we get — 1 = B ; 
hence 

x 2 — l=Ax(x+}) — x — \ ; or x 2 + x = Ax(x+l)i 
and x+1 = A(jj+1\ 



126 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

so that -4=1, and the partial fractions are: 

x-1 2_ 

x 2 +l x+1' 
Take as another example the fraction 

(x 2 +l)(x 2 + 2y 
We get 

ar»-2 Ax+B Cx+D 

(x* + l)(x' + 2) x 2 + l + x 2 + 2 

_( Ax+B)(x 2 +2) + (Cx+D)(a?+l) 
(x 2 +l){x 2 +2) 

In this case the determination of A , B, C, D is not 
so easy. It will be simpler to proceed as follows: 
Since the given fraction and the fraction found by 
adding the partial fractions are equal, and have 
identical denominators, the numerators must also be 
identically the same. In such a case, and for such 
algebraical expressions as those with which we are 
dealing here, the coefficients of the same powers of x 
are equal and of same sign. 

Hence, since 

a?-2 = (Ax+B)(x 2 +2)+(Cx+D)(a?+l) 

= (A + C)x* + (B+D)x 2 +(2A + C)x+2B+D, 
we have l = A + 0; = B+D (the coefficient of st? 
in the left expression being zero); = 2.4+ C; and 
— 2 = 2B+D. Here are four equations, from which 
we readily obtain A = — 1; B-— 2; (7=2; D = 2; 

SO that the partial fractions are ^ ■ o ^T -i 



OTHER USEFUL DODGES 12? 

This method can always he used; but the method 
shown first will be found the quickest in the case of 
factors in x only. 

Case III. When among the factors of the denomi- 
nator there are some which are raised to some power, 
one must allow for the possible existence of partial 
fractions having for denominator the several powers 
of that factor up to the highest. For instance, in 

Sx 2 — 2#?-}-l 
splitting the fraction -; — tt\2/"~ — o\ we mu st allow for 

\X t1) \X — Z ) 

the possible existence of a denominator x+1 as well 
as(>+l) 2 and (x-2). 

It maybe thought, however, that, since the numerator 
of the fraction the denominator of which is {x+1) 1 
may contain terms in x, we must allow for this in 
writing Ax+B for its numerator, so that 

3eE 2 -2#+l _Ax±B G , D 



(x+l)\x-2) (x+lf^x+l^x-2* 

If, however, we try to find A,B, C and D in this case, 
we fail, because we get four unknowns : and we have 
only three relations connecting them, yet

(x+l)%x-2) (x+l) 2 ^x+l^x-2* 
But if we write 

3a? 2 -2a?+l A B C 

{x+lf(x-2) (x+l?*x+l + x-2 9 
we get 
3a?-2x+l=A(x-2)+B(x+l)(x-2) + C(x+iy>

which gives C= 1 for x = 2. Replacing C by its value, 
transposing, gathering like terms, and dividing by 
% — 2, we get — 2x = A+B(x+l) } which gives A = —2 
for x= — 1. Replacing A by its value, we get 

2x=-2+B(x+l). 

Hence j? = 2 ; so that the partial fractions are:

We see that it is sufficient to allow for one numerical 
term in each numerator, and that we always get the 
ultimate partial fractions. 

When there is a power of a factor of x 2 in the 
denominator, however, the corresponding numerators 
must be of the form Ax+B; for example, 

3#-l Ax+B Cx+D B

we get

Hence 2(7=16 and C=8; 2D= -16 and D= -8; 
A-O=0or^-8 = 0andA = 8;andfmally,,B-i) = 3

(2a? 2 -l) 2 + 2# 2 - f #+1* 

It is useful to check the results obtained. The 
simplest way is to replace x by a single value, saj 
-f I, both in the given expression and in the partial 
fractions obtained. 

Whenever the denominator contains but a power of 
a single factor, a very quick method is as follows :

CHAPTER XIV. 

ON TEUE COMPOUND INTEREST AND THE 
LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH. 

Let there be a quantity growing in such a way that 
the increment of its growth, during a given time, 
shall always be proportional to its own magnitude. 
This resembles the process of reckoning interest on 
money at some fixed rate ; for the bigger the capital, 
the bigger the amount of interest on it in a given 
time. 

Now we must distinguish clearly between two 
cases, in our calculation, according as the calculation 
is made by what the arithmetic books call "simple 
interest," or by what they call "compound interest." 
For in the former case the capital remains fixed, 
while in the latter the interest is added to the cap- 
ital, which therefore increases by successive additions. 

(1) At simple interest Consider a concrete case. 
Let the capital at start be £100, and let the rate 
of interest be 10 per cent, per annum. Then the 
increment to the owner of the capital will be £10 
every year. Let him go on drawing his interest 
every year, and hoard it by putting it by in a

goes on for 10 years, by the end of that time he will 
have received 10 increments of £10 each, or £100, 
making, with the original £100, a total of £200 in all. 
His property will have doubled itself in 10 years. 
If the rate of interest had been 5 per cent., he would 
have had to hoard for 20 years to double his property. 
If it had been only 2 per cent., he would have had 
to hoard for 50 years. It is easy to see that if the 

value of the yearly interest is — of the capital, he 

must go on hoarding for n years in order to double 
his property. 

Or, if y be the original capital, and the yearly 

y 

interest is — , then, at the end of n years, his property 

will be y+n- = 2y. 

(2) At compound interest. As before, let the owner 
begin with a capital of £100, earning interest at the 
rate of 10 per cent, per annum; but, instead of 
hoarding the interest, let it be added to the capital 
each year, so that the capital grows year by year. 
Then, at the end of one year, the capital will have 
grown to £110 ; and in the second year (still at 10 %) 
this will earn £11 interest. He will start the third 
year with £121, and the interest on that will be 
£12. 2s.; so that he starts the fourth year with 
£133. 2s., and so on. It is easy to work it out, and 
find that at the end of the ten years the total capital 



136^ CALCULUS MADE EAST 

will have grown to £259. 7s. 6d. In fact, we see that 
at the end of each year, each pound will have earned 
yV of a pound, and therefore, if this is always added 
on, each year multiplies the capital by \% ; and if 
continued for ten years (which will multiply by this 
factor ten times over) the original capital will be 
multiplied by 2*59375. Let us put this into symbols. 

Put y for the original capital; - for the fraction 

Ifb 

added on at each of the n operations ; and y n for the 
value, of the capital at the end of the n th operation. 

Then yn=sy °( 1+ «) ' 

But this mode of reckoning compound interest once 
a year, is really not quite fair; for even during the 
first year the £100 ought to have been growing. At 
the end of half a year it ought to have been at least 
£105, and it certainly would have been fairer had 
the interest for the second half of the year been 
calculated on £105. This would be equivalent to 
calling it 5 % per half-year ; with 20 operations, there- 
fore, at each of which the capital is multiplied by -§-£. 
If reckoned this way, by the end of ten years the 
capital would have grown to £265. 8s. ; for 

(1 + 2V) 20 = 2-654. 

But, even so, the process is still not quite fair ; for, 

hy the end of the first month, there will be some 

interest earned ; and a half-yearly reckoning assumes 

that the capital remains stationary for six months at 



ON TRUE COMPOUND INTEREST 137 

a time. Suppose we divided the year into 10 parts, 
and reckon a one-per-cent. interest for each tenth of 
the year. We now have 100 operations lasting over 
the ten years ; or 

y n = £100(1+^)100; 

which works out to £270. 8s. 

Even this is not final. Let the ten years be divided 
into 1000 periods, each of T ^ w of a year ; the interest 
being T V per cent, for each such period ; then 

^n=£ioo(i+ T ^Vo) 1000 ; 

which works out to £271. 14s. 2JcZ. 

Go even more minutely, and divide the ten years 
into 10,000 parts, each y^Vrr °f a y ear > with interest 
at y^j- of 1 per cent. Then 

y„ = £100 (1+^1^)10.000. 

which amounts to £271. 16s. 4cZ. 

Finally, it will be seen that what we are trying to 
find is in reality the ultimate value of the expression 

flH — J , which, as we see, is greater than 2; and 

which, as we take n larger and larger, grows closer 
and closer to a particular limiting value. However 
big you make n, the value of this expression grows 
nearer and nearer to the figure 

2-71828... 
a number never to be forgotten.

It is divided into 10 periods, in each of which there is 

an equal step up. Here -j- is a constant ; and if each 

step up is -j 3 ^ of the original OP, then, by 10 such 
steps, the height is doubled. If we had taken 20 steps,

each of half the height shown, at the end the height 
would still be just doubled. Or n such steps, each 

of — of the original height OP, would suffice to 

double the height. This is the case of simple interest. 
Here is 1 growing till it becomes 2. 

In Fig. 37, we have the corresponding illustration of 
the geometrical progression. Each of the successive 

ordinates is to be 1 + -, that is, times as high as 

its predecessor. The steps up are not equal, because 

each step up is now — of the ordinate at that part of 

the curve. If we had literally 10 steps, with (1+xfr) 
for the multiplying factor, the final total would be

we take n sufficiently large (and the corresponding

which unity will grow will be 2 71828.

Epsilon. To this mysterious number 2*7182818 
etc., the mathematicians have assigned as a symbol 
the Greek letter e (pronounced epsilori) or the English 
letter e. All schoolboys know that the Greek letter tt 
(called jpz) stands for 3441592 etc. ; but how many of 
them know that epsilon means 2*71828 ? Yet it is an 
even more important number than tt\ 

What, then, is epsilon? 

Suppose we were to let 1 grow at simple interest 
till it became 2; then, if at the same nominal rate of 
interest, and for the same time, we were to let 1 grow 
at true compound interest, instead of simple, it would 
grow to the value epsilon. 

This process of growing proportionately, at every 
instant, to the magnitude at that instant, some people 



140 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

call a logarithmic rate of growing. Unit logarithmic 
rate of growth is that rate which in unit time will 
cause 1 to grow to 2*718281. It might also be 
called the organic rate of growing: because it is 
characteristic of organic growth (in certain circum- 
stances) that the increment of the organism in a 
given time is proportional to the magnitude of the 
organism itself. 

If we take 100 per cent, as the unit of rate, 
and any fixed period as the unit of time, then the 
result of letting 1 grow arithmetically at unit rate, 
for unit time, will be 2, while the result of letting 1 
grow logarithmically at unit rate, for the same time, 
will be 2-71828.... 

A little more about Epsilon. We have seen that 
we require to know what value is reached by the 

expression m — J , when n becomes indefinitely 

great. Arithmetically, here are tabulated a lot of 
values (which anybody can calculate out by the help 
of an ordinary table of logarithms) got by assuming 
n = 2; w = 5; w=10; and so on, up to w = 10,000.

It is, however, worth while to find another way of 
calculating this immensely important figure. 

Accordingly, we will avail ourselves of the binomial

Now, if we suppose w to become indefinitely great, 
say a billion, or a billion billions, then n — 1, w — 2, 
and ?i — 3, etc., will all be sensibly equal to w; and 
then the series becomes 

e = l + l + l+l-+j| + ete.... 

By taking this rapidly convergent series to as 
many terms as we please, we can work out the sum to 
any desired point of accuracy. Here is the working

This series is called the exponential series. 

The great reason why e is regarded of importance 
is that e x possesses a property, not possessed by any 
other function of x, that when you differentiate it 
its value remains unchanged ; or, in other words, its 
differential coefficient is the same as itself. This can 
be instantly seen by differentiating it with respect 
to x, thus :

or =l + x+ Y ^ 2 + TTT - 7s + 1 . 2S4i +etc., 

which is exactly the same as the original series. 

Now we might have gone to work the other way, 
and said : Go to ; let us find a function of x, such 
that its differential coefficient is the same as itself. 
Or, is there any expression, involving only powers 



144 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

of x> which is unchanged by differentiation ? Accord- 
ingly, let us assuvie as a general expression that 

y = A + Bx + Cx 2 + Dx s + Ex* + etc., 

(in which the coefficients A, B } C, etc. will have to be 
determined), and differentiate it. 

^ = B+2Cx+8Da?+4,Ea?+eto. 

Now, if this new expression is really to be the same 
as that from which it was derived, it is clear that 

Amust=B; that(7=-^- = 1 — ~; thatZ) = -5- = : 



2 1-2' 3 1-2.3' 

that ^=_ = r - ¥7 ^, etc. 

The law of change is therefore that 

If, now, we take A = 1 for the sake of further 
simplicity, we have 

Differentiating it any number of times will give 
always the same series over again. 

If, now, we take the particular case of A=l, and 
evaluate the series, we shall get simply 

when a? = 1, y — 2*718281 etc. ; that is, y = e; 
when x = 2, y = (2*718281 etc) 2 ; that is, y = e 2 ; 
when x = 3, y = (2*718281 etc.) 3 : that is, y = e z \ 



THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH i« 

and therefore 

when x = x, y = (2718281 etc.)*; that is, y = e x > 
thus finally demonstrating that 

^ = 1+ l + rT2 + rT2T3 + TT2^T4 + etc - 

[Note. — iTo^ to read exponentials. For the benefit 
of those who have no tutor at hand it may be of use 
to state that e x is read as " epsilon to the eksth power ; " 
or some people read it "exponential eks" So e pt is 
read " epsilon to the pee-teeth-power " or " exponential 
pee tee" Take some similar expressions : — Thus, e~ 2 is 
read "epsilon to the minus tivo power " or " exponential 
minus two" e~ ax is read "epsilon to the minus 
ay-eksth ' ; or " exponential minus ay-eks."] 

Of course it follows that e y remains unchanged if 
differentiated with respect to y. Also e ax , which is 
equal to (e a Y, will, when differentiated with respect 
to x, be ae ax , because a is a constant. 

Natural or Napierian Logarithms. 

Another reason why e is important is because it 
was made by Napier, the inventor of logarithms, the 
basis of his system. If y is the value of e x , then x 
is the logarithm, to the base e, of y. Or, if 

y = e* y 

then x = loge y.

It will be seen that, though the calculations yield 
different points for plotting, yet the result is identical 
The two equations really mean the same thing. 

As many persons who use ordinary logarithms, 
which are calculated to base 10 instead of base e, are 
unfamiliar with the " natural " logarithms, it may be 
worth while to say a word about them. The ordinary 
rule that adding logarithms gives the logarithm of 
the product still holds good ; or 

log e a + log e b = log e ah 
Also the rule of powers holds good ; 

wxlog e a=log e a n . 



THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH 147 

But as 10 is no longer the basis, one cannot multiply 
by 100 or 1000 by merely adding 2 or 3 to the 
index. One can change the natural logarithm to 
the ordinary logarithm simply by multiplying it by 
0*4343; or log 10 a? = 0*4343 x log e #, 
and conversely, log e x = 2*3026 X log 10 x.

Exponential and Logarithmic Equations. 
Now let us try our hands at differentiating certain 
expressions that contain logarithms or exponentials. 
Take the equation : 

y = loge x. 
First transform this into 

e y = #,

whence, since the differential of e y witn regard to y is 
the original function unchanged (see p. 143),

and, reverting from the inverse to the original func- 
tion # = _L = i = l 
dx dx e y x 
dy 
Now this is a very curious result. It may be 
written d(los e x) 
dx 
Note that x' 1 is a result that we could never have 
got by the rule for differentiating powers. That rule 
(page 25) is to multiply by the power, and reduce the 
power by 1. Thus, differentiating a? gave us 3x 2 '. 
and differentiating x 2 gave 2&- 1 . But differentiating 
x° gives us 0x^ _1 = 0, because x° is itself =1, and 
is a constant. We shall have to come back to this 
curious fact that differentiating log e a? gives us* 

— when we reach the chapter on integrating. 



Now, try to differentiate 

y = log e (x+a), 
that is e y = x + a; 

we- have — — ^ - = e y . since the differential of e 9 

dy 

.remains e y .

If two successive ordinates are related together 
thus in a constant ratio, their logarithms will have a 
constant difference; so that, if we should plot out 
a new curve, Fig. 41, with values of \og € y as ordinates, 
it would be a straight line sloping up by equal steps. 
In fact, it follows from the equation, that 

log e y=log e 6+a?.log e p, 

whence log e y — log e b = x • log, p. 

Now, since \og e p is a mere number, and may be 
written as log e p = a, it follows that 

* b 

and the equation takes the new form 

y = be ax .

The Die-away Curve. 

If we were to take p as a proper fraction (less than 
unity), the curve would obviously tend to sink down- 
wards, as in Fig. 42, where each successive ordinate 
is | of the height of the preceding one. 

The equation is still 

y = bp* ; 




* X 



"but since p is less than one, log e p will be a negative 
quantity, and may be written —a; so that p = e~ a , 
and now our equation for the curve takes the form 
y = b€~ ax . 
The importance of this expression is that, in the 
case where the independent variable is time, the 
equation represents the course of a great many 
physical processes in which something is gradually 
dying away. Thus, the cooling of a hot body is 
represented (in Newton's celebrated " law of cooling ") 
by the equation Q t — Q € - « • 



THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH 157 

where O is the original excess of temperature of a 
hot body over that of its surroundings, 6 t the excess 
of temperature at- the end of time t, and a is a con- 
stant — namely, the constant of decrement, depending 
on the amount of surface exposed by the body, and 
on its coefficients of conductivity and emissivity, 
etc. 

A similar formula, 

is used to express the charge of an electrified body, 
originally having a charge Q Qy which is leaking away 
with a constant of decrement a; which constant 
depends in this case on the capacity of the body and 
on the resistance of the leakage-path. 

Oscillations given to a flexible spring die out after 
a time; and the dying-out of the amplitude of the 
motion may be expressed in a similar way. 

In fact e~ at serves as a die-away factor for all 
those phenomena in which the rate of decrease 
is proportional to the magnitude of that which is 

decreasing; or where, in our usual symbols, -^- is 

ctt 

proportional at every moment to the value that y has 

at that moment. For we have only to inspect the 

curve, Fig. 42 above, to see that, at every part of it, 

the slope -f- is proportional to the height y; the 

curve becoming flatter as y grows smaller. Id sym- 
bols, thus r -««

or log e y = log, b — ax log e e = log e b — ax, 

and, differentiating, - -j- = — a ; 

hence ~ = b€- ax x( — a)= —ay; 

or, in words, the slope of the curve is downward, and 
proportional to y and to the constant a. 

We should have got the same result if we had 
taken the equation in the form 

y=bp x \ 
for then —*- = bp x X log, p. 

But log e p=— a; 

giving us J^ = yx (-a)= -ay, 

as before. 



The Time-constant In the expression for the " die- 
away factor" €~ at , the quantity a is the reciprocal of 
another quantity known as " the time-constant" which 
we may denote by the symbol T. Then the die-away 

factor will be written e~ T \ and it will be seen, by 

making t=T that the meaning of T (or of - J is that 

this is the length of time which it takes for the original 
quantity (called or Q in the preceding instances) 

to die away to -th part — that is to 0*3678 — of its 
original value.

As an example of the use of this table, suppose 
there is a hot body cooling, and that at the beginning 



160 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

of the experiment (i.e> when £ = 0) it is 72° hotter than 
the surrounding objects, and if the time-constant of its 
cooling is 20 minutes (that is, if it takes 20 minutes 

for its excess of temperature to fall to - part of 72°) 

then we can calculate to what it will have fallen in 
any given time t. For instance, let t be 60 minutes. 

Then ^=60-*- 20 = 3, and we shall have to find the 

value of e~ z , and then multiply the original 72° by 
this. The table shows that e -3 is 0*0498. So that 
at the end of 60 minutes the excess of temperature 
will have fallen to 72° x 0*0498 = 3*586°. 



Further Examples. 

(1) The strength of an electric current in a con- 
ductor at a time t sees, after the application of the 
electromotive force producing it is given by the ex-

the time-constant being 01. This means that it 

takes 0*01 sec. for the variable term to fall to 

1 ° 

- = 0*3678 of its initial value 10e"ooi = lO. 

e 

To find the value of the current when t = 0*001 sec, 
say, |>=0*1, e- 0,1 = 0*9048 (from table). 

It follows that, after 0001 sec, the variable term 
is 0*9048x10 = 9*048, and the actual current is 
10-9-048 = 0*952. 

Similarly, at the end of 0*1 sec, 

^=10; e- 10 = 0*000045; 

the variable term is 10 x 0*000045 = 0*00045, the current 
being 9*9995. 

(2) The intensity / of a beam of light which has 
passed through a thickness I cm. of some transparent 
medium is I=I €~ Kl i where I is the initial intensity 
of the beam and K is a " constant of absorption." 

This constant is usually found by experiments If 
it be found, for instance, that a beam of light has 
its intensity diminished by 1 8 % in passing through 
10 cms. of a certain transparent medium, this means 
that 82 = 100xe- /LTxl ° or e- 10 *=0*82, and from the 
table one sees that 10iT=0*20 very nearly; hence 
J5T=002. 

To find the thickness that will reduce the intensity 
to half its value, one must find the value of I which 
satisfies the equality 50 = 100xe-°' 02f , or 0'b = e~°' m .

CHAPTER XV. 
HOW TO DEAL WITH SINES AND COSINES. 

Greek letters being usual to denote angles, we will 
take as the usual letter for any variable angle the 
letter 9 (" theta "). 

Let us consider the function 
y = sin Q. 




Fig. 43. 

What we have to investigate is the value of " ' ; 

or, in other words, if the angle 6 varies, we have to 
find the relation between the increment of the sine 
and the increment of the angle, both increments being 
indefinitely small in themselves. Examine Fig. 43, 
wherein, if the radius of the circle is unity, the height 
of y is the sine, and 6 is the angle. Now, if 6 is 



166 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

supposed to increase by the addition to it of the 
small angle d6 — an element of angle — the height 
of y, the sine, will be increased by a small element dy. 
The new height y + dy will be the sine of the new 
angle 6 + d6, or, stating it as an equation, 

y+dy = sin(Q+d6); 

and subtracting from this the first equation gives 

dy = sin (0 + d&) — sin 0. 

The quantity on the right-hand side is the difference 
between two sines, and books on trigonometry tell 
us how to work this out. For they tell us that if 
M and N are two different angles, , 

sin M — sin N = 2 cos — = — • sin — ~ — . 

If, then, we put M=6+d9 for one angle, and 
N= 6 for the other, we may write 

, ^ e+de+e . e+do-o 

dy = 2 cos 5 • sin ^ » 

or, dy = 2 cos (0 + \d&) • sin £dft 

But if we regard d0 as indefinitely small, then in 
the limit we may neglect \dQ by comparison with 6, 
and may also take sin \dQ as being the same as \dQ. 
The equation then becomes : 

dy = 2cos8x %d0; 

dy = cos 6 • dd, 

and, finally, -^ = cos 0.

The accompanying curves, Figs. 44 and 45, show,

Sometimes, in mechanical and physical questions, 
as, for example, in simple harmonic motion and in 
wave-motions, we have to deal with angles that in- 
crease in proportion to the time. Thus, if T be the 
time of one complete period, or movement round the 
circle, then, since the angle all round the circle is 2ir 
radians, or 360°, the amount of angle moved through 
in time t, will be 

= 271"^-, in radians, 



or 



0=360-=, in degrees. 



170 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

If the frequency, or number of periods per second, 
be denoted by n, then n = 7 p i and we may then write: 

= 27rnt. 
Then we shall have 

y = sin2'7mt. 
If, now, we wish to know how the sine varies with 
respect to time, we must differentiate with respect, not 
to 6, but to t. For this we must resort to the artifice 
explained in Chapter IX., p. 67, and put 

dy__dy dd

dO 
Now -^- will obviously be 2-wn ; so that 

-^ = cos#x2'7ra

Second Differential Coefficient of Sine or Cosine. 

We have seen that when sin 6 is differentiated with 
respect to 6 it becomes cos 6 ; and that when cos 9 is 
differentiated with respect to 6 it becomes — sinfi; 
or, in symbols, 

d 2 (sin0) . a 



SINES AND COSINES 171 

So we have this curious result that we have found 
a function such that if we differentiate it twice over, 
we get the same thing from which we started, but 
with the sign changed from -f to — . 

The same thing is true for the cosine ; for differen- 
tiating cos 6 gives us — sin 0, and differentiating 
—sin 9 gives us —cos 6 ; or thus : 

-^r-= -cos ft 

Sines and cosines are the only functions of which 
the second differential coefficient is equal and of 
opposite sign to the original function. 



Examples. 

With what we have so far learned we can now 
differentiate expressions of a more complex nature.

If y is the arc whose sine is x, then x — sin y.

CHAPTER XVI. 

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIATION. 

We sometimes come across quantities that are func- 
tions of more than one independent variable. Thus, 
we may find a case where y depends on two other 
variable quantities, one of which we will call u and 
the other v. In symbols 

y=f(u ) v). 

Take the simplest concrete case. 

Let y=uxv. 

What are we to do? If we were to treat v as a 
constant, and differentiate with respect to it, we 
should get dtj v = vdu; 

or if we treat u as a constant, and differentiate with 
respect to v, we should have : 
dy u = adv. 

The little letters here put as subscripts are to show 
which quantity has been taken as constant in the 
operation. 

Another way of indicating that the differentiation 
has been performed only partially, that is, has been 
performed only with respect to one of the independent 



176 CALCULUS MADE EAST 

variables, is to write the differential coefficients with 
Greek deltas, like d, instead of little d. In this way 

If we put in these values for v and u respectively, 
we shall have 

\ which are partial differentials. 

But, if you think of it, you will observe that the 
total variation of y depends on both these things at 
the same time. That is to say, if both are varying, 
the real dy ought to be written 

dy = ^-du + ^dv ; 

* du dv 

and this is called a total differential. In some books 
it is written dy = (-f^j du+(-r-j dv. 

Example (1). Find the partial differential co- 
efficients of the expression w = 2ax 2 + Sbxy+4icy\ 
The answers are : 

~ = ±ax+3oy. 
^==3bx+12cy*. 



PARTIAL DIFFERENTIATION 177 

The first is obtained by supposing y constant, the 
second is obtained by supposing x constant ; then 
dw = (4?ax+3by)dx+(3bx+l 2cy 2 )dy. 

Example (2). Let z = x y . Then, treating first y 
and then x as constant, we get in the usual way 

dz , f 

^- / = a^xlog € a?,j 

so that dz = yx y ~ 1 dx+ x y log e x dy. 

Example (3). A cone having height h and radins 
of base r, has volume V— ^7rr 2 A. If its height remains 
constant, while r changes, the ratio of change of 
volume, with respect to radius, is different from ratio 
of change of volume with respect to height which 
would occur if the height were varied and the radius 
kept constant, for 

— = — rh, 

dr S 

*V * 2 

The variation when both the radius and the height 

27T V 

change is given by dV= -~-rh dr -f - r^d/i.

Example (4). In the following example F and f 
denote two arbitrary functions of any form whatso- 
ever. For example, they may be sine-functions, or 
exponentials, or mere algebraic functions of the two

independent variables, t and x. This being under 
stood, let us take the expression 

y = F{x + at) +f(x - at),

CHAPTER XVII. 

INTEGRATION. 

The great secret has already been revealed that this 

mysterious symbol I , which is after all only a long S, 

merely means " the sum of," or " the sum of all such 
quantities as." It therefore resembles that other 
symbol 2 (the Greek Sigma), which is also a sign 
of summation. There is this difference, however, in 
the practice of mathematical men as to the use of 
these signs, that while 2 is generally used to indicate 
the sum of a number of finite quantities, the integral 

sign I is generally used to indicate the summing up 

of a vast number of small quantities of indefinitely 
minute magnitude, mere elements in fact, that go 

to make up the total required. Thus 1 dy = y, and 

\dx = x. 

Any one can understand how the whole of anything 
can be conceived of as made up of a lot of little bits; 
and the smaller the bits the more of them there will 
be. Thus, a line one inch long, may be conceived as 
made up of 10 pieces, each -^ of an inch long; or 
of 100 parts, each part being -j-J^ of an inch long; 



INTEGRATION 183 

or of 1,000,000 parts, each of which is 100 * 000 of an 
inch long; or, pushing the thought to the limits of 
conceivability, it may be regarded as made up of 
an infinite number of elements each of which is 
infinitesimally small. 

Yes, you will say, but what is the use of thinking 
of anything that way ? Why not think of it straight 
off, as a whole ? The simple reason is that there are 
a vast number of cases in which one canuot calculate 
the bigness of the thing as a whole without reckoning 
up the sum of a lot of small parts. The process of 
" integrating " is to enable us to calculate totals that 
otherwise we should be unable to estimate directly. 

Let us first take one or two simple cases to 
familiarize ourselves with this notion of summing 
up a, lot of separate parts. 

Consider the series : 

l + i+i + i+xV+*V+Ar+etc. 

Here each member of the series is formed by taking 
it half the value of the preceding. What is the value 
of the total if we could go on to an infinite number 
of terms ? Every schoolboy knows that the answer 
is 2. Think of it, if you like, as a line. Begin with 



Fig 4C. 

one inch; add a half inch; add a quarter; add an 
eighth ; and so on. If at any point of the operation 



184 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

we stop, there will still be a piece wanting to make 
up the whole 2 inches; and the piece wanting will 
always be the same size as the last piece added. 
Thus, if after having put together 1, £, and J, we stop, 
there will be £ wanting. If we go on till we have 
added ^, there will still be -^ wanting. The 
remainder needed will always be equal to the last 
term added. By an infinite number of operations 
only .should we reach the actual 2 inches. Practically 
we should reach it when we got to pieces so small 
that they could not be drawn — that would be after 
about 10 terms, for the eleventh term is ttfVt- ^ we 
want to go so far that not even a Whitworth's 
measuring machine would detect it, we should merely 
have to go to about 20 terms. A microscope would 
not show even the 18 th term ! So the infinite number 
of operations is no such dreadful thing after all. 
The integral is simply the whole lot. But, as we 
shall see, there are cases in which the integral 
calculus enables us to get at the exact total that 
there would be as the result of an infinite number 
of operations. In such cases the integral calculus 
gives us a rapid and easy way of getting at a result 
that would otherwise require an interminable lot of 
elaborate working out. So we had best lose no time 
in learning how to integrate.

Slopes of Curves, and the Curves themselves. 

Let us make a little preliminary enquiry about the 
slopes of curves. For we have seen that differentiating 
a curve means finding an expression for its slope (or 
for its slopes at different points). Can we perform 
the reverse process of reconstructing the whole curve 
if the slope (or slopes) are prescribed for us ? 

Go back to case (2) on p. 84. Here we have the 
simplest of curves, a sloping line with the equation 

y = ax+b. 



4 




X 



Fig. 47 



We know that here b represents the initial height 

of y when x = 0, and that a, which is the same as -~ y 
* ax 

is the "slope" of the line. The line has a constant 

slope. All along it the elementary triangles ^^ \ **& 

dx 
have the same proportion between height and base. 

Suppose we were to take the dx'a and dy's of finite 



186 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



magnitude, so that 10 dx'a made up one inch, then 
there would be ten little triangles like 

Now, suppose that we were ordered to reconstruct 
the "curve," starting merely from the information 

that ;/ =#• What could we do? Still taking the 

little d's as of finite size, we could draw 10 of them, 
all with the same slope, and then put them together, 
end to end, like this : 



Y 


x»- - 














'f* ^ 


<{ 






o 


* 





Fig. 48. 



And, as the slope is the same for all, they would join 
to make, as in Fig. 48, a sloping line sloping with the 

correct slope -^ = a. And whether we take the dy's 

and dxs as finite or infinitely small, as they are all 



INTEGRATION 18? 

alike, clearly - = a, if we reckon y as the total of 

all the dy's, and x as the total of all the dx's. But 
whereabouts are we to put this sloping line? Are 
we to start at the origin 0, or higher up? As the 
only information we have is as to the slope, we are 
without any instructions as to the particular height 
above ; in fact the initial height is undetermined. 
The slope will be the same, whatever the initial height. 
Let us therefore make a shot at what may be wanted, 
and start the sloping line at a height C above O. 
That is, we have the equation 

y = ax+C. 

It becomes evident now that in this case the added 
constant means the particular value that y has when 
x = 0. 

Now let us take a harder case, that of a line, the 
slope of which is not constant, but turns up more and 
more. Let us assume that the upward slope gets 
greater and greater in proportion as x grows. In 
symbols this is : 

dy 

-j L = ax. 

ax 

Or, to give a concrete case, take a — \ } so that 



dx

Then we had best begin by calculating a few of 
the values of the slope at different values of x, and 
also draw little diagrams of them.

taken bits half as long, and twice as numerous, like 
Fig. 50, we should have a better approximation. But 



INTEGRATION 



189 



for a perfect curve we ought to take each dx and its 
corresponding dy infinitesimally small, and infinitely 



numerous. 




Then, how much ought the value of any y to be ? 
Clearly, at any point P of the curve, the value of 
y will be the sum of all the little dy's from up to 

that level, that is to say, \dy = y. And as each dy is 

equal to \x • dx, it follows that the whole y will be 
equal to the sum of all such bits as \x • dx, or, as we 

should write it, \\x • dx. 

Now if x had been constant, l^#?«6fa? would have 
been the same as ^a?ldfe, or \x 2 . But x began by 



being 0, and increases to the particular value of x at 
the point P, so that its average value from to that 

point is %x. Hence Uatffa^^a? 2 ; or y = ^j T x 2 . 

But, as in the previous case, this requires the addition 
of an undetermined constant C, because we have not 



190 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



been told at what height above the origin the curve 
will begin, when x = 0. So we write, as the equation 
of the curve drawn in Fig. 51, 

y = T \x*+C.

CHAPTER XVIIL 

INTEGRATING AS THE REVERSE OF 
DIFFERENTIATING. 

Differentiating is the process by which when y is 

given us (as a function of x), we can find -p. 

Like every other mathematical operation, the 
process of differentiation may be reversed. Thus, if 

differentiating y = x* gives us -=^ = 4a? 3 , then, if one 

begins with -p = 4a? 3 , one would say that reversing the 

process would yield y = a? 4 . But here comes in a curious 

point. We should get -^- = 4a? 3 if we had begun with 

any of the following: a? 4 , or x*+a, or x* + c, or x* 
with any added constant. So it is clear that in 

working backwards from -^- to y } one must make 

provision for the possibility of there being an added 
constant, the value of which will be undetermined 



192 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

until ascertained in some other way. So, if differ- 
entiating x 11 yields nx 71 ' 1 , going backwards from 

-^- = nx 71 ' 1 will give us y = x n +C; where C stands 

for the yet undetermined possible constant. 

Clearly, in dealing with powers of x, the rule for 
working backwards will be : Increase the power by 1, 
then divide by that increased power, and add the 
undetermined constant. 

So, in the case where 

dx~ X ' 

working backwards, we get 

If differentiating the equation y = ax n gives us 

dy 
dx~ 

it is a matter of common sense that beginning with 



dy_ 



anx 



,n-l 



dx~ 

and reversing the process, will give us 

y = ax n . 

So, when we are dealing with a multiplying constant, 
we must simply put the constant as a multiplier of 
the result of the integration. 



HOW TO INTEGRATE 193 

Thus, if -J£ = 4<x 2 , the reverse process gives us 

But this is incomplete. For we must remember 
that if we had started with 

y = ax n +C, 
where O is any constant quantity whatever, we should 
equally have found 

P = anx n -\ 
dx 

So, therefore, when we reverse the process we must 
always remember to add on this undetermined con- 
stant, even if we do not yet know what its value 
will be. 

This process, the reverse of differentiating, is called 
integrating; for it consists in finding the value of 
the whole quantity y when you are given only an 

expression for dy or for — K Hitherto we have as 

much as possible kept dy and dx together as a dif- 
ferential coefficient: henceforth we shall more often 
have to separate them. 

If we begin with a simple case, 

dx 

We may write this, if we like, as 
dy = x 2 dx. 

Now this is a " differential equation " which informs 
us that an element of y is equal to the corresponding 
element of x multiplied by x\ Now, what we want 

C.M%E. N 



194 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

is the integral ; therefore, write down with the proper 
symbol the instructions to integrate both sides, thus : 



\dy=\ 



x 2 dx. 



[Note as to reading integrals : the above would be 
read thus : 

"Integral dee-wy equals integral eks-squared dee-eks."] 

We haven't yet integrated: we have only written 
down instructions to integrate — if we can. Let us 
try. Plenty of other fools can do it — why not we 
also? The left-hand side is simplicity itself. The 
sum of all the bits of y is the same thing as y itself. 
So we may at once put : 

y= I x 2 dx. 

But when we come to the right-hand side of the 
equation we must remember that what we have got 
to sum up together is not all the dx's, but all such 
terms as x 2 dx; and this will not be the same as 



Adx, 



because x 2 is not a constant. For some of the 



dx's will be multiplied by big values of x 2 , and some 
will be multiplied by small values of x 2 , according to 
what x happens to be. So we must bethink ourselves 
as to what we know about this process of integration 
being the reverse of differentiation. Now, our rule 
for this reversed process — see p. 191 ante — when 
dealing with x n is "increase the power by one, and 
divide by the same number as this increased power." 



HOW TO INTEGRATE 195 

That is to say, x*dx will be changed* to %x\ Put 
this into the equation; but don't forget to add the 
" constant of integration " C at the end. So we get : 

You have actually performed the integration. How 
easy I 

Let us try another simple case. 

Let ^ = ax 12 , 

ax 

where a is any constant multiplier. Well, we found 
when differentiating (see p. 29) that any constant 
factor in the value of y reappeared unchanged in the 

value of -^. In the reversed process of integrating, 

(XX 

it will therefore also reappear in the value of y. So 
we may go to work as before, thus : 

dy = ax 12 • dx, 



l*-i 



ax 12 • dx, 



\dy = a\x 12 dx, 

y = ax^ s x ls +C. 
So that is done. How easy 1 

* You may ask : what has become of the little dx at the end ? 
Well, remember that it was really part of the differential coefficient, 
and when changed over to the right-hand side, as in the x 2 dx, 
serves as a reminder that x is the independent variable with respect 
to which the operation is to be effected ; and, as the result of the 
product being totalled up, the power of x has increased by one, 
You will soon become familiar with all this. 



196 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

We begin to realize now that integrating is a 
process of finding our way back, as compared with 
differentiating. If ever, during differentiating, we 
have found any particular expression — in this example 
ax 12 — we can find our way back to the y from which 
it was derived. The contrast between the two pro- 
cesses may be illustrated by the following illustration 
due to a well-known teacher. If a stranger were set 
down in Trafalgar Square, and told to find his way to 
Euston Station, he might find the task hopeless. But 
if he had previously been personally conducted from 
Euston Station to Trafalgar Square, it would be 
comparatively easy to him to find his way back to 
Euston Station. 



Integration of the Sum or Difference of two 
Functions. 

Let g = ^2 + a* 

then dy=x 2 dx+x z dx* 

There is no reason why we should not integrate 
each term separately: for, as may be seen on p. 35, 
we found that when we differentiated the sum of two 
separate functions, the differential coefficient was 
simply the sum of the two separate differentiations. 
So, when we work backwards, integrating, the integra- 
tion will be simply the sum of the two separate 
integrations. 



\dy = \(a 



HOW TO INTEGRATE 197 

Our instructions will then be : 
{x 2 +a?)dx 

= \x 2 dx+\x?dx 

If cither of the terms had been a negative quantity, 
the corresponding term in the integral would have 
also been negative. So that differences are as readily 
dealt with as sums. 

How to deal with Constant Terms. 

Suppose there is in the expression to be integrated 
a constant term — such as this : 

This is laughably easy. For you have only to 

remember that when you differentiated the expression 

cL'ii 
y = ax, the result was -j^ = a. Hence, when you work 

the other way and integrate, the constant reappears 
multiplied by x. So we get 

dy = x n dx+b • dx, 

\dy= \x n dx+ \bdx, 

y = —l- 1 x n + 1 + bx+C. 

Here are a lot of examples on which to try your 
newly acquired powers.

All these are easy enough. Let us try another casa 

Let J r- = ax~ 1 . 

ax 

Proceeding as before, we will write 

dy = ax~ 1 'dx i \dy = a\x' 1 dx. 

Well, but what is the integral of x~ 1 dx? 
If you look back amongst the results of differen- 
tiating x 2 and x 3 and x n , etc., you will find we never 

got x~ l from any one of them as the value of -^. 

We got 3a? 2 from x*; we got 2x from x 2 : we got 1 
from x 1 (that is, from x itself) ; but we did not get 
x' 1 from x°, for two very good reasons. First, x° is 
simply =1, and is a constant, and could not have 



EASIEST INTEGRATIONS 199 

a differential coefficient. Secondly, even if it could 
be differentiated, its differential coefficient (got by 
slavishly following the usual rule) would be Ox a?" 1 , 
and that multiplication by zero gives it zero value! 
Therefore when we now come to try to integrate 
x~ l dx, we see that it does not come in anywhere 
in the powers of x that are given by the rule : 

It is an exceptional case. 

Well ; but try again. Look through all the various 
differentials obtained from various functions of x> and 
try to find amongst them x'\ A sufficient search 

will show that we actually did get ^ = x~ x as the 

result of differentiating the function y = \og^x (see 
p. 148). 

Then, of course, since we know that differentiating 
log, x gives us x~\ we know that, by reversing the 
process, integrating dy = X' 1 dx will give us y = log € x. 
But we must not forget the constant factor a that 
was given, nor must we omit to add the undetermined 
constant of integration. This then gives us as the 
solution to the present problem, 

y = a\og e x+C. 

N.B. — Here note this very remarkable fact, that we 
could not have integrated in the above case if we had 
not happened to know the corresponding differentia- 
tion. If no one had found out that differentiating 
loge# gave a?" 1 , we should have been utterly stuck by 



200 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

, the problem how to integrate x~ x dx. Indeed it should 
be frankly admitted that this is one of the curious 
features of the integral calculus : — that you can't 
integrate anything before the reverse process of differ- 
entiating something else has yielded that expression 
which you want to integrate. No one, even to-day, 
is able to find the general integral of the expression, 

dx~ a ' 

because a~* 2 has never yet been found to result from 
differentiating anything else. 

Another simple case. 

Find \(x + l)(x + 2)dx. 

On looking at the function to be integrated, you 
remark that it is the product of two different functions 
of x. You could, you think, integrate (x+l)dx by 
itself, or (x+2)dx by itself. Of course you could. 
But what to do with a product ? None of the differ- 
entiations you have learned have yielded you for the 
differential coefficient a product like this. Failing 
such, the simplest thing is to multiply up the two 
functions, and then integrate. This gives us 

[(x 2 + Sx+2)dx. 

And this is the same as 

\x 2 dx+\3xdx+\2dx. 

And performing the integrations, we get 
ia?+%x i +2x+a 



SOME OTHER INTEGRALS 201 

Some other Integrals. 

Now that we know that integration is the reverse 
of differentiation, we may at once look up the differ- 
ential coefficients we already know, and see from 
what functions they were derived. This gives us the 
following integrals ready made : 

x~ 1 (p. 148); b?" 1 ^ = log e x+C.

DOUBLE INTEGRALS 203 

On Double and Triple Integrals. 

in many cases it is necessary to integrate some 
expression for two or more variables contained in it ; 
and in that case the sign of integration appears more 
than once. Thus, 



!!■ 



f(%, y,)dxdy 



means that some function of the variables x and y 
has to be integrated for each. It does not matter in 
which order they are done. Thus, take the function 
x 2 -\-y 2 . Integrating it with respect to x gives us: 

I (x 2 + y 2 ) dx = ^ + xy\ 

Now, integrate this with respect to y : 

I (ix z + xy 2 )dy = i x z y + \xif, 

to which of course a constant is to be added. If we 
had reversed the order of the operations, the result 
would have been the same. 

In dealing with areas of surfaces and of solids, we 
have often to integrate both for length and breadth, 
and thus have integrals of the form 



w 



icdxdy, 



where u is some property that depends, at each point, 
on x and on y. This would then be called a surface- 
integral. It indicates that the value of all such 



204 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

elements e^awdx'dy (that is to say, of the value of u 
over a little rectangle dx long and dy broad) has to be 
summed up over the whole length and whole breadth. 
Similarly in the case of solids, where we deal with 
three dimensions. Consider any element of volume, 
the small cube whose dimensions are dx dy dz. If 
the figure of the solid be expressed by the function 
f(x, y, z), then the whole solid will have the volume- 
integral, 

volume = 1 1 1 /(#> y> 2) • dx • dy • dz. 

Naturally, such integrations have to be taken be- 
tween appropriate limits* in each dimension ; and the 
integration cannot be performed unless one knows in 
what way the boundaries of the surface depend on 
x, y, and & If the limits for x are from x x to x 2 > 
those for y from y x to y 2 , and those for % from z x 
to z 2 > then clearly we have 

f(%>y>z)-dx'dy-dz. 

There are of course plenty of complicated and 
difficult cases; but, in general, it is quite easy to 
see the significance of the symbols where they are 
intended to indicate that a certain integration has to 
be performed over a given surface, or throughout a 
given solid space.

CHAPTER XIX. 

ON FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING. 

One use of the integral calculus is to enable us to 
ascertain the values of areas bounded by curves. 
Let us try to get at the subject bit by bit. 

Y 




Let AB (Fig. 52) be a curve, the equation to which 
is known. That is, y in this curve is some known 
function of x. Think of a piece of the curve from 
the point P to the point Q. 

Let a perpendicular PM be dropped from P, and 
another QN from the point Q. Then call OM=x 1 
and ON"=x 2 , and the ordinates PM=j/ 1 and QN=y%. 
We have thus marked out the area PQNM that lies 



FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING 207 

beneath the piece PQ. The problem is, how can we 
calculate the value of this area ? 

The secret of solving this problem is to conceive 
the area as being divided up into a lot of narrow 
strips, each of them being of the width dx. The 
smaller we take dx, the more of them there will be 
between x x and x 2 . Now, the whole area is clearly- 
equal to the sum of the areas of all such strips. Our 
business will then be to discover an expression for 
the area of any one narrow strip, and to integrate it 
so as to add together all the strips. Now think of 
any one of the strips. It will be like this: 
being bounded between two vertical sides, with 
a flat bottom dx, and with a slightly curved 
sloping top. Suppose we take its average 
height as being y ; then, as its width is dx, its 
area will be ydx. And seeing that we may 
take the width as narrow as we please, if we 
only take it narrow enough its average height will be 
the same as the height at the middle of it. Now 
let us call the unknown value of the whole area 
8, meaning surface The area of one strip will be 
simply a bit of the whole area, and may therefore 
be called dS. So we may write 

area of 1 strip = dS = y- dx. 

If then we add up all the strips, we get 

total area S= \dS= I ydx. 

So then our finding S depends on whether we can 



208 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

integrate y • dx for the particular case, when we know 
what the value of y is as a function of x. 

For instance, if you were told that for the particular 
curve in question y = b + ax?, no doubt you could put 
that value into the expression and say : then I must 

find I (b + ax 2 )dx. 

That is all very well ; but a little thought will show 
you that something more must be done. Because the 
area we are trying to find is not the area under the 
whole length of the curve, but only the area limited 
on the left by PM, and on the right by QN, it follows 
that we must do something to define our area between 
those ' limits,' 

This introduces us to a new notion, namely that of 
integrating between limits. We suppose x to vary, 
and for the present purpose we do not require any 
value of x below x x (that is OM), nor any value of 
x above x 2 (that is ON). When an integral is to be 
thus defined between two limits, we call the lower 
of the two values the inferior limit, and the upper 
value the superior limit. Any integral so limited 
we designate as a definite integral, by way of dis- 
tinguishing it from a general integral to which no 
limits are assigned. 

In the symbols which give instructions to integrate, 
the limits are marked by putting them at the top 
and bottom respectively of the sign of integration. 
Thus the instruction - ^ 

I y*dx 

Jx=x x 



FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING 209 

will be read : find the integral of y • dx between the 
inferior limit os 1 and the superior limit a? 2 . 
Sometimes the thing is written more simply 

y • dx. 

Well, but how do you find an integral between limits, 
when you have got these instructions ? 

Look again at Fig. 52 (p. 206). Suppose we could 
find the area under the larger piece of curve from 
A to Q, that is from x = to x = x 2 , naming the area 
AQNO. Then, suppose we could find the area under 
the smaller piece from A to P, that is from x = to 
x = x v namely the area APMO. If then we were to 
subtract the smaller area from the larger, we should 
have left as a remainder the area PQNM, which is 
what we want. Here we have the clue as to what 
to do ; the definite integral between the two limits is 
the difference between the integral worked out for 
the superior limit and the integral worked out for the 
lower limit. 

Let us then go ahead. First, find the general 
integral thus: f ^ 

and, as y = b + ax 2 is the equation to the curve (Fig. 52), 
Ub+aa?)dx 

is the general integral which we must find. 

Doing the integration in question by the rule 
'.p. 196), we get ^M, 

C.M.E. O 



6a%+oO? 2 8 +C r ; 



210 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

and this will be the whole area from up to any 
value of x that we may assign. 

Therefore, the larger area up to the superior limit 
x 2 will be t a 

" ''3 £ 
and the smaller area up to the inferior limit x x will be 

Now, subtract the smaller from the larger, and we 
get for the area S the value, 

area S=b(x 2 — x 1 ) + -~(x 2 z — xf). 

This is the answer we wanted. Let us give some 
numerical values. Suppose 6 = 10, a = 0*06, and x 2 = 8 
and x x = 6. Then the area S is equal to 

10(8-6) + ( -^(8 3 -6 3 ) 

= 20 + 0-02(512-216) 
= 20 + 0*02x296 
= 20 + 5*92 
= 25-92. 

Let us here put down a symbolic way of statin| 
what we have ascertained about limits : 

ydx = y 2 -y v 

J X = Xi 

where y 2 is the integrated value of ydx corresponds 
to x 2> and y x that corresponding to x v 



FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING 211 

All integration between limits requires the differ- 
ence between two values to be thus found. Also note 
that, in making the subtraction the added constant O 
has disappeared. 



Examples. 

(1) To familiarize ourselves with the process, let us 
take a case of which we know the answer beforehand. 
Let us find the area of the triangle (Fig. 53), which 

y 




has base a? =12 and height y = 4. We know before- 
hand, from obvious mensuration, that the answer will 
come 24. 

Now, here we have as the " curve " a sloping line 
for which the equation is 

x 

The area in question will be

Note that, in dealing with definite integrals, the 
constant C always disappears by subtraction. 

Let us satisfy ourselves about this rather sur- 
prising dodge of calcula- 
tion, by testing it on 
a simple example. Get 
some squared paper, pre- 
, ferably some that is 
ruled in little squares of

Now reckon out the area beneath the curve by 
counting the little squares below the line, from x = 
as far as a? =12 on the right. There are 18 whole 
squares and four triangles, each of which has an area 
equal to 1J squares; or, in total, 24 squares. Hence 

24 is the numerical value of the integral of ~dx 

between the lower limit of x = and the higher limit 
of a? = 12. 

As a further exercise, show that the value of the 
same integral between the limits of a? = 3 and x = 15 
is 36.

Let it be noted that this process of subtracting one 
part from a larger to find the difference is really a 
common practice. How do you find the area of a

plane ring (Fig. 56), the outer radius cf which is r 2 
and the inner radius is r a ? You know from men- 
suration that the area of the outer circle is irr 2 ; then 
you find the area of the inner circle, irr*\ then you 
subtract the latter from the former, and find area of 
ring = 7r(r 2 2 — r x 2 ); which may be written 

= mean circumference of ring X width of ring. 
(3) Here's another case — that of the die-away curve

(4) Another example is afforded by the adiabatic 
curve of a perfect gas, the equation to which is 
pv n = c, where p stands for pressure, v for volume, 
and n is of the value 1*42 (Fig. 58).

An Exercise. 

Prove the ordinary mensuration formula, that the 
area A of a circle whose radius is R, is equal to ttR 2 . 

Consider an elementary zone or annulus of the 
surface (Fig. 59), of breadth dr, situated at a distance 




Fig. 59. 

r from the centre. We may consider the entire sur- 
face as consisting of such narrow zones, and the 
whole area A will simply be the integral of all 
such elementary zones from centre to margin, that is, 
integrated from r = to r = R. 

We have therefore to find an expression for the 



FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING 217 

elementary area dA of the narrow zone. Think of 
it as a strip of breadth dr, and of a length that is 
the periphery of the circle of radius r, that is, a 
length of 27rr. Then we have, as the area of the 
narrow zone, ^ = 2irrdr. 

Hence the area of the whole circle will be : 

r Cr=R Cr=R 

A = \dA = \ 2Trvdr=2Tr\ r-dr. 

J Jr=0 Jr=0 

Now, the general integral of r • dr is ^r 2 . Therefore, 
A = 2tt\^T R ; 

L -lr=0 

or ^ = 27r[^-J(0) 2 ]; 

whence A = ttR\ 

Another Exercise. 

Let us find the mean ordinate of the positive part 
of the curve y = x—<x?, which is shown in Fig. 60. 

Y 




Fig. 60. 

To find the mean ordinate, we shall have to find the 
area of the piece OMN, and then divide it by the 
length of the base ON. But before we can find 
the area we must ascertain the length of the base, 
so as to know up to what limit we are to integrate. 



218 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

At N the ordinate y has zero value; therefore, we 
must look at the equation and see what value of x 
will make y = 0. Now, clearly, if x is 0, y will also be 
0, the curve passing through the origin ; but also, 
if x = l, y = 0: so that x — 1 gives us the position of 
the point N. 

Then the area wanted is 

= \%-x 2 )dx = \ix*-ix*T = [i-i]-[0-0]=i. 

Jx=0 L_ Jo 

But the base length is 1. 

Therefore, the average ordinate of the curve = £. 

[N.B. — It will be a pretty and simple exercise in 
maxima and minima to find by differentiation what 
is the height of the maximum ordinate. It must be 
greater than the average.] 

The mean ordinate of any curve, over a range from 
# = to x = x v is given by the expression, 



1 f*=*i 7 
mean y = — y • ax.

Areas in Polar Coordinates. 

When the equation of the boundary of an area is 
given as a function of the distance r of a point of it 
trom a fixed point (see Fig. 61) called the pole, and 




Fig. 61. 

of the angle which r makes with the positive hori- 
zontal direction OX, the process just explained can 
be applied just as easily, with a small modification. 
Instead of a strip of area, we consider a small triangle 
OAB, the angle at being d9, and we find the sum 
of all the little triangles making up the required 
area. 

The area of such a small triangle is approximately 

—~-xr or — ~— xr; hence the portion of the area

Volumes by Integration. 

What we have done with the area of a little strip 
of a surface, we can, of course, just as easily do with 
the volume of a little strip of a solid. We can add 
up all the little strips that make up the total solid, 
and find its volume, just as we have added up all the 
small little bits that made up an area to find the final 
area of the figure operated upon.

We can also proceed as follows: a slice of tlu 
sphere, of thickness dx, has for volume iry 2 dx (see 
Fig. 62). Also x and y are related by the expression

On Quadratic Means. 
In certain branches of physics, particularly in the 
study of alternating electric currents, it is necessary 
to be able to calculate the quadratic mean of a 
variable quantity. By "quadratic mean" is denoted 
the square root of the mean of the squares of all the 
values between the limits considered. Other names 
for the quadratic mean of any quantity are its 
"virtual" value, or its "b.m.s." (meaning root-mean- 
square) value. The French term is valeur efficace. If 
y is the function under consideration, and the quad- 
ratic mean is to be taken between the limits of x = 
and x = I ; then the quadratic mean is expressed as 

2 /iT r

DODGES, PITFALLS, AND TRIUMPHS. 

Bodges. A great part of the labour of integrating 
things consists in licking them into some shape that 
can be integrated. The books — and by this is meant 
the serious books — on the Integral Calculus are full 
of plans and methods and dodges and artifices for 
this kind of work. The following are a few of 
them. 

Integration by Parts, This name is given to a 
dodge, the formula for which is 

\udx = ux — \xdu+C. 

It is useful in some cases that you can't tackle 
directly, for it shows that if in any case \xdu can 
be found, then \udx can also be found. The formula 
can be deduced as follows. From p. 38, we have, 

d(ux) = udx + x du, 
which may be written 

uclx= d(ux) — xdu, 
which by direct integration gives the above expression. 



DODGES, PITFALLS, AND TRIUMPHS 22? 

Examples. 

(1) Find \w> sin wdw. 

Write u = w, and for sin w • dw write dx. We shall 
then have du = dw, while I sin w • dw = — cos w = x. 
Putting these into the formula, we get 

\W'Smwdw = w( — cosw) — I — coswdw 
= — w cos w+ sin w+C. 

(2) Find \xe x dx. 

Write u = x, e x dx = dv, 

then du = dx, v = e x , 

and I xe x dx = xe x — \e x dx (by the formula) 

= X£ X - € x = € X (X- 1) + C

sometimes in more than one way (which are equivalent 
to one another). 

Pitfalls, A beginner is liable to overlook certain 
points that a practised hand would avoid ; such as 
the use of factors that are equivalent to either zero or 
infinity, and the occurrence of indeterminate quantities 
such as %. There is no golden rule that will meet 
every possible case. Nothing but practice and intelli- 
gent care will avail. An example of a pitfall which 
had to be circumvented arose in Chap. XVIII., p. 199, 
when we came to the problem of integrating x~ 1 dx. 

Triumphs. By triumphs must be understood the 
successes with which the calculus has been applied to 
the solution of problems otherwise intractable. Often 
in the consideration of physical relations one is able 
to build up an expression for the law governing the 
interaction of the parts or of the forces that govern 
them, such expression being naturally in the form of 
a differential equation, that is an equation containing 
differential coefficients with or without other algebraic 
quantities. And when such a differential equation 
has been found, one can get no further until it has 
been integrated. Generally it is much easier to state 
the appropriate differential equation than to solve it : 
the real trouble begins then only when one wants to 
integrate, unless indeed the equation is seen to possess 
some standard form of which the integral is known, 
and then the triumph is easy. The equation which 
results from integrating a differential equation is 



232 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

called* its "solution"; and it is quite astonishing 
how in many cases the solution looks as if it had no 
relation to the differential equation of which it is 
the integrated form. The solution often seems as 
different from the original expression as a butterfly- 
does from the caterpillar that it was. Who would 
have supposed that such an innocent thing as 

dy^ 1 

dx a 2 — x 2 
could blossom out into 

v 2a 6 a-x 
yet the latter is the solution of the former. 

As a last example, let us work out the above together

*This means that the actual result of solving it is called its 
"solution." But many mathematicians would say, with Professor 
Forsyth, "every differential equation is considered as solved when 
the value of the dependent variable is expressed as a function ol 
the independent variable by means either of known functions, or of 
integrals, whether the integrations in the latter can or cannot be 
expressed in terms of functions already known."

CHAPTER XXL 

FINDING SOLUTIONS. 

In this chapter we go to work finding solutions to 
some important differential equations, using for this 
purpose the processes shown in the preceding chapters. 
The beginner, who now knows how easy most of 
those processes are in themselves, will here begin to 
realize that integration -is an art. As in all arts, so 
in this, facility can be acquired only by diligent and 
regular practice. He who would attain that facility 
must work out examples, and more examples, and yet 
more examples, such as are found abundantly in all 
the regular treatises on the Calculus. Our purpose 
here must be to afford the briefest introduction to 
serious work. 



Example 1. Find the solution of the differential

equation ay + b-J^=0.

Now the mere inspection of this relation tells us 

that we have got to do with a case in which -¥- is 
& dx 

proportional to y. If we think of the curve which 

will represent y as a function of x, it will be such 

that its slope at any point will be proportional to 

the ordinate at that point, and will be a negative 

slope if y is positive. So obviously the curve will 

be a die-away curve (p. 156), and the solution will 

contain €~ x as a factor. But, without presuming on 

this bit of sagacity, let us go to work. 

As both y and dy occur in the equation and on 

opposite sides, we can do nothing until we get both 

y and dy to one side, and dx to the other. To do 

this, we must split our usually inseparable companions 

dy and dx from one another. 

^--^dx 

y b 

Having done the deed, we now can see that both 
sides have got into a shape that is integrable, because 

we recognize -J-, or -dy, as a differential that we 

have met with (p. 147) when differentiating logarithms. 
So we may at once write down the instructions to 
integrate, r 7 r 

and doing the two integrations, we have ;

where log 6 C is the yet undetermined constant * of 
integration. Then, delogarizing. we get : 

y=Ce **, 

which is the solution required. Now, this solution 
looks quite unlike the original differential equation 
from which it was constructed : yet to an expert 
mathematician they both convey the same information 
as to the way in which y depends on x. 

Now, as to the O, its meaning depends on the 
initial value of y. For if we put x = in order to 
see what value y then has, we find that this makes 
y=Ce-°; and as e-° = l, we see that C is nothing else 
than the particular value t of y at starting. This we 
may call y , and so write the solution as 

a 



Example 2. 

Let us take as an example to solve

integration," and the form log e G is adopted here by preference, 
because the other terms in this line of equation are, or are treated 
as logarithms ; and it saves complications afterward if the added 
constant be of the sam-e kind.

Now we have done our best to get nothing but y 
and dy on one side, and nothing but dx on the other.

writing the instructions to integrate, we have :

The last term is obviously a term which will die 
out as t increases, and may be omitted. The trouble 
now comes in to find the integral that appears as a 
factor. To tackle this we resort to the device (see 
p. 226) of integration by parts, the general formula for 

which is \udv = uv— \vdu. For this purpose write 

J u = e bt ; 
[ dv = sin27rnt'dt.

Example 4. 

Suppose that Mdx+Ndy — O. 

We could integrate this expression directly, if M 
were a function of x only, and N a function of y 
only; but, if both M and N are functions that depend 
on both x and y, how are we to integrate it ? Is it 
itself an exact differential ? That is : have M and N 
each been formed by partial differentiation from some 
common function U, or not ? If they have, then

It is possible in such cases to discover, however, an 
integrating factor, that is to say, a factor such that 
if both are multiplied by this factor, the expression 
will become an exact differential. There is no one 
rule for discovering such an integrating factor ; but 
experience will usually suggest one. In the present 
instance 2x will act as such. Multiplying by 2x } we 

get (2x+6x 2 y)dx+2x?dy = 0. 

Now apply the test to this.

may be integrated. Now, if w = 2x z y, 

dw = 6x 2 y dx + 2a? dy. 
Hence 1 6x 2 y dx + 1 2x z dy = w = 2%?y ;

In this case we have a differential equation of the

It appears from this that we have to do with a 
function such that its second differential coefficient is 
proportional to itself, but with reversed sign. In 
Chapter XV. we found that there was such a func- 
tion — namely, the sine (or the cosine also) which 
possessed this property. So, without further ado, 
we may infer that the solution will be of the form

Here we have obviously to deal with a function $

It was seen (p. 177) that this equation was derived

Another way of dealing with it is to transform it 
by a change of variables into

where u = x+at, and v = x— at, leading to the same 
general solution. If we consider a case in which 
F vanishes, then we have simply 

y=f{x-at)\ 

and this merely states that, at the time t = 0, y is a 
particular function of x, and may be looked upon as 
denoting that the curve of the relation of y to x has 
a particular shape. Then any change in the value 
of t is equivalent simply to an alteration in the origin 
from which x is reckoned. That is to say, it indicates 
that, the form of the function being conserved, it is 
propagated along the x direction with a uniform 
velocity a; so that whatever the value of the

CHAPTER XXII. 

A LITTLE MORE ABOUT CURVATURE 
OF CURVES. 

In Chapter XII. we have learned how we can find out 
which way a curve is curved, that is, whether it 
curves upwards or downwards towards the right. 
This gave us no indication whatever as to how much 
the curve is curved, or, in other words, what is its 
curvature. 

By curvature of a line, we mean the amount of 
bending or deflection taking place along a certain 
length of the line, say along a portion of the line the 
length of which is one unit of length (the same unit 
which is used to measure the radius, whether it be 
one inch, one foot, or any other unit). For instance, 
consider two circular paths of centre O and O' and of 
equal lengths AB, A'B (see Fig. 64). When passing 
from A to B along the arc AB of the first one, one 
changes one's direction from AP to BQ, since at A 
one faces in the direction AP and at B one faces in 
the direction BQ. In other words, in walking from A 
to B one unconsciously turns round through the angle 
POQ, which is equal to the angle AOB. Similarly, 



250 



CALCULUS MADE EASY 



in passing from A' to B\ along the arc A'B\ of 
equal length to AB, on the second path, one turns 
round through the angle P'(JQ\ which is equal to the 
angle A'0'B\ obviously greater than the correspond- 




FlG. 64. 



ing angle A OB. The second path bends therefore 
more than the first for an equal length. 

This fact is expressed by saying that the curvature 
of the second path is greater than that of the first 
one. The larger the circle, the lesser the bending, 
that is the lesser the curvature. If the radius of the 
first circle is 2, 3, 4, ... etc. times greater than the 
radius of the second, then the angle of bending or 
deflection along an arc of unit length will be 2, 3, 
4, ... etc. times less on the first circle than on the 
second, that is, it will be ■£-,£,■},... etc. of the bending 
or deflection along the arc of same length on the 
second circle. In other words, the curvature of the 



CURVATURE OF CURVES 251 

first circle will be £, i, i, ... etc. of that of the second 
circle. We see that, as the radius becomes 2, 3, 4, .. 
etc. times greater, the curvature becomes 2, 3, 4, ... 
etc. times smaller, and this is expressed by saying that 
the curvature of a circle is inversely proportional to 
the radius of the circle, or 

1 



curvature = h X 



radius ' 



where h is a constant. It is agreed to take k=l, so 

that i 

curvature = — r . — , 
radius 

always. 

If the radius becomes indefinitely great, the curva- 
ture becomes . n .. =zero, since when the denomi- 
lnnnity 

nator of a fraction is indefinitely large, the value of 
the fraction is indefinitely small. For this reason 
mathematicians sometimes consider a straight line as 
an arc of circle of infinite radius, or zero curvature. 

In the case of a circle, which is perfectly symmetri- 
cal and uniform, so that the curvature is the same at 
every point of its circumference, the above method of 
expressing the curvature is perfectly definite. In the 
case of any other curve, however, the curvature is 
not the same at different points, and it may differ 
considerably even for two points fairly close to one 
another. It would not then be accurate to take the 
amount of bending or deflection between two points 
as a measure of the curvature of the arc between

these points, unless this are is very small, in fact, 
unless it is indefinitely small. 

If then we consider a very small arc such as AB (see 
Fig. 65), and if we draw such a circle that an arc AB 




Fig. 65. 



of this circle coincides with the arc AB of the curve 
more closely than would be the case with any other 
circle, then the curvature of this circle may be taken 
as the curvature of the arc AB of the curve. The 
smaller the arc AB, the easier it will be to find a 
circle an arc of which most nearly coincides with the 
arc AB of the curve. When A and B are very near 
one another, so that AB is so small so that the length 
ds of the arc AB is practically negligible, then the 
coincidence of the two arcs, of circle and of curve, 
may be considered as being practically perfect, and 
the curvature of the curve at the point A (or B),

CURVATURE OF CURVES 253 

being then the same as the curvature of the circle, 
will be expressed by the reciprocal of the radius of 

this circle, that is, by -^-j, according to our way of 

measuring curvature, explained above. 

Now, at first, you may think that, if AB is very 
small, then the circle must be very small also. A little 
thinking will, however, cause you to perceive that it is 
by no means necessarily so, and that the circle may 
have any size, according to the amount of bending of 
the curve along this very small arc AB. In fact, 
if the curve is almost flat af that point, the circle will 
be extremely large. This circle is called the circle of 
curvature, or the osculating circle at the point con- 
sidered. Its radius is the radius of curvature of the 
curve at that particular point. 

If the arc AB is represented by ds and the angle 
AOB by dO, then, if r is the radius of curvature, 

ds = rd6 or -1- = -. 
ds r 

The secant AB makes with the axis OX the angle 
6, and it will be seen from the small triangle ABC 

that -~ = tebii6. When AB is indefinitely small, so 

that B practically coincides with A, the line AB 
becomes a tangent to the curve at the point A 
(or B). 

Now, tan 6 depends on the position of the point A 
(or B, which is supposed to nearly coincide with it),

that is, it depends on x, or, in other words, tan 6 is 
"a function" of x.

The numerator, being a square root, may have the

always, as a negative radius would have no meaning. 



CURVATURE OF CURVES 255 

It has been shown (Chapter XII.), that if -^\ is 
positive, the curve is convex downwards, while if 
-j- 2 ^ is negative, the curve is concave downwards. If 

-~ = 0, the radius of curvature is infinitely great, 

that is, the corresponding portion of the curve is a bit 
of straight line. This necessarily happens whenever 
a curve gradually changes from being convex to con- 
cave to the axis of x or vice versa. The point where 
this occurs is called a point of inflexion. 

The centre of the circle of curvature is called the 
centre of curvature. If its coordinates are x v y v then 
the equation of the circle is (see p. 102) 

(x-x l Y+(y-y 1 ) 2 =r 2 ; 
hence 2 {x —x 1 )dx + 2(y—y 1 )dy = 0, 

and x-x l + (y-y 1 )-£^ = (1) 

Why did we differentiate ? To get rid of the con- 
stant r. This leaves but two unknown constants x x 
and y x ; differentiate again ; you shall get rid of one of 
them. This last differentiation is not quite as easy as

HOW TO FIND THE LENGTH OF AN ARC ON 
A CURVE. 

Since an arc on any curve is made up of a lot of 
little bits of straight lines joined end to end, if we 
could add all these little bits, we would get the 
length of the arc. But we have seen that to add a 
lot of little bits together is precisely what is called

integration, so that it is likely that, since we know 
how to integrate, we can find also the length of an 



LENGTH OF AN ARC ON A CURVE 267 

arc on any curve, provided that the equation of the 
curve is such that it lend itself to integration. 

If MN is an arc on any curve, the length s of 
which is required (see Fig. 66a), if we call "a little 
bit " of the arc ds, then we see at once that 

{dsf = (dx? + (dy)\ 
or either 

^V 1+ (§) 2 ^ or * = V 1+ dl) 2<foj - 

Now the arc MN is made up of the sum of all the 
little bits ds between M and N y that is, between x x 
and x 2i or between y x and y 2 , so that we get either 

That is all ! 

The second integral is useful when there are several 
points of the curve corresponding to the given values 
of x (as in Fig 666). In this case the integral between 
x x and x 2 leaves a doubt as to the exact portion of the 
curve, the length of which is required. It may be 
ST, instead of MN, or SQ , by integrating between 
y x and y 2 the uncertainty is removed, and in this case 
one should use the second integral. 

If instead of x and y coordinates, — or Cartesian 
coordinates, as they are named from the French 
mathematician Descartes, who invented them — we 
have r and 6 coordinates (or polar coordinates, see 
p. 219) ; then, if MN be a small arc of length ds on 



268 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

any curve, the length s of which is required (see 
Fig. 67), being the pole, then the distance ON will 
generally differ from OM by a small amount dr. If 
the small angle MON is called d6, then, the polar 
coordinates of the point M being 6 and r, those of N 
are (6+d6) and (r+dr). Let MP be perpendicular 




to ON, and let OR = OM; then RN=dr, and this 
is very nearly the same as PN y as long as d$ is 
a very small angle. Also EM=rd9, and RM is 
very nearly equal to PM, and the arc MN is very 
nearly equal to the chord MN. In fact we can write 
PN=dr, PM=rd8, and arc MN= chord Jf#" with- 
out appreciable error, so that we have . 

(ds)2 = ( c hord MNy = PN 2 + PM 2 ^=dr 2 +r 2 d6\

We can proceed at once to work out a few examples. 

Example 1. The equation of a circle, the centre of 
which is at the origin — or intersection of the axis of

to integrate here. 

Hence s = J /L® x 2) = r arc(sin~) + (7, C being a

x = and x = r, we write

the graph. This is only approximate. Now plot 
again, on as large a scale as possible, taking only 
three values of y, 1*6, 1*7, 1*8. On this second graph, 
which is nearly, but not quite a straight line, you 
will be probably able to read any value of y correct 
to three places of decimals, and this is sufficient for 
our purpose. We find from the graph that y = 1*723 
corresponds to x=l. Then 

= 3(log e r741-0)=l*66. 

If we wanted a more accurate value of y we could 
plot a third graph, taking for values of y 1*722, 1*723, 
1*724, . . . ; this would give us, correct to five places of 
decimals, the value of y corresponding to a? = l, and 
so on, till the required accuracy is reached. 

Example 5. Find the length of an arc of the 
logarithmic spiral r = e 6 between 6 = and 6=1 radian. 

Do you remember differentiating y = e x l It is an 
easy one to remember, for it remains always the same 

whatever is done to it: -f- — ^ (see p. 143). 

Here, since r = e e , T^ = e ° = ^ 
d6 

If we reverse the process and integrate 1 e Q d6 we 
get back to r+C, the constant C being always intro-

duced by such a process, as we have seen in Chap. 
XVII. 

It follows that 

Integrating between the two given values = 
and 6 = 1, we get . 

= s/2e 1 -s/2e°=j2(e-l) 
= 1-41 x 1*713 = 2-42 inches, 
since r = e° = l inch when = 0. 

Example 6,. Find the length of an arc of the 
logarithmic spiral r = e e between = and 6 = 6 V 
As we have just seen, 

s = V2[V^ = x/2pi-e°l = >v/^(^-l)- 

Example 7. As a last example let us work fully a 
case leading to a typical integration which will be 
found useful for several of the exercises found at the 
end of this chapter. Let us find the expression for 



a 



the length of an arc of the curve y = ^x 2 +S.

Integrate this by parts : let 

u = s/l + a 2 oc? and dx — dv; 
then x = v and au = 



by the method of differentiation explained in Chap. IX, 
Since \udv = uv—\vdu (see p. 226), we have 

\s/l + a 2 a^dx = x^/l + a 2 ofi—a 2 \—7^= = 2^' W 
Also, we can write 

hence

Adding (!) and (2) we get

let Vl + & 2 a? 2 = v—ax ; then 

l + a- 2 ^ 2 = v 2 — 2avx+a 2 x 2 or l=v 2 —2avx. 

Differentiating this, to get rid of the constant, we gef,

,, , . 7 (v—ax)dv , . f c?a? 

that is dx = - — ; replacing m \— f === we

hence . =-log € (ax+*Jl+a 2 x 2 ).

Replacing in (3) and dividing by 2 we get, finally, 
s = ]s/l + a 2 x 2 dx 

= ^ x/l + a 2 x 2 + 5- log e (ax + *Jl + a 2 x 2 )> 

which can easily be calculated between any given 
limits. 

You ought now to be able to attempt with success 
the following exercises. You will find it interesting 
as well as instructive to plot the curves and verify 
your results by measurement where possible. 

The integration is usually of the kind shown on 
p. 228, Ex. (5), or p. 229, Ex. (1), or p. 278, Ex. (7).

You have now been personally conducted over the 
frontiers into the enchanted land. And in order that 
you may have a handy reference to the principal 
results, the author, in bidding you farewell, begs to 
present you with a passport in the shape of a con- 
venient collection of standard forms (see pp. 286, 287). 
In the middle column are set down a number of the 
functions which most commonly occur. The results 
of differentiating them are set down on the left ; the 
results of integrating them are set down on the righto

EPILOGUE AND APOLOGUE. 

It may be confidently assumed that when this 
tractate "Calculus made Easy" falls into the hands 
of the professional mathematicians, they will (if not 
too lazy) rise up as one man, and damn it as being a 
thoroughly bad book. Of that there can be, from 
their point of view, no possible manner of doubt 
whatever. It commits several most grievous and 
deplorable errors. 

First, it shows how ridiculously easy most of the 
operations of the calculus really are. 

Secondly, it gives away so many trade secrets. By 
showing you that what one fool can do, other fools 
can do also, it lets you see that these mathematical 
swells, who pride themselves on having mastered such 
an awfully difficult subject as the calculus, have no 
such great reason to be puffed up. They like you to 
think how terribly difficult it is, and don't want that 
superstition to be rudely dissipated. 

Thirdly, among the dreadful things they will say 
about " So Easy " is this : that there is an utter failure 
on the part of the author to demonstrate with rigid 



284 CALCULUS MADE EASY 

and satisfactory completeness the validity of sundry 
methods which he has presented in simple fashion, 
and has even dared to use in solving problems ! But 
why should he not? You don't forbid the use of 
a watch to every person who does not know how to 
make one ? You don't object to the musician playing 
on a violin that he has not himself constructed. You 
don't teach the rules of syntax to children until they 
have already become fluent in the use of speech. It 
would be equally absurd to require general rigid 
demonstrations to be expounded to beginners in the 
calculus. 

One other thing will the professed mathematicians 
say about this thoroughly bad and vicious book : that 
the reason why it is so easy is because the author has 
left out all the things that are really difficult. And 
the ghastly fact about this accusation is that — it 
is true ! That is, indeed, why the book has been 
written — written for the legion of innocents who have 
hitherto been deterred from acquiring the elements of 
the calculus by the stupid way in which its teaching 
is almost always presented. Any subject can be made 
repulsive by presenting it bristling with difficulties. 
The aim of this book is to enable beginners to learn 
its language, to acquire familiarity with its endearing 
simplicities, and to grasp its powerful methods oi 
solving problems, without being compelled to toil 
through the intricate out-of-the-way (and mostly 
irrelevant) mathematical gymnastics so dear to the 
unpractical mathematician. 



EPILOGUE AND APOLOGUE 285 

There are amongst young engineers a number on 
whose ears the adage that what one fool can do, 
another can, may fall with a familiar sound. They 
are earnestly requested not to give the author 
away, nor to tell the mathematicians what a fool 
he really is.

298 ANSWERS 

1 

(13) Quadratic mean=-^ N /j[ 1 2+^ 3 2. arithmetical mean =0. 

The first involves a somewhat difficult integral, and may be 
stated thus : By definition the quadratic mean will be 

y 2~ f \A X sin x+A 3 sin Zxfdx. 
Now the integration indicated by 

f(A 1 2 sm 2 x + 2A 1 A 3 smx8m3x+A 3 2 8m 2 3x)dx 

is more readily obtained if for sin 2 a; we write 

1 - cos 2x 

2 b 

For 2 sin x sin 3x we write cos 2x - cos 4x ; and, for sin 2 3aj, 

1 — cos 6x 
2 
Making these substitutions, and integrating, we get (see 
p. 202) 

A *[x 8in2x ) \ A^lJ *™ 2 * sinto )l^ 3 Ya3 sin6,X Y 

At the lower limit the substitution of for x causes all 
this to vanish, whilst at the upper limit the substitu- 
tion of 27r for x gives A x 2 7r + A 3 2 tt. And hence the 
answer follows. 

(14) Area is 62*6 square units. Mean ordinate is 10'42. 
(16) 436*3. (This solid is pear shaped.)

Every earnest student is exhorted to manufacture more 
examples for himself at every stage, so as to test his powers. 
When integrating he can always test his answer by differ- 
entiating it, to see whether he gets back the expression from 
which he started. 

There are lots of books which give examples for practice. 
It will suffice here to name two ; R G. Blaine's The Calculus 
and its Applications, and F. M„ Saxelby's A Course in Practical 
Mathematics.
